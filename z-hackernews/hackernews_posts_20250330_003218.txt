   Text: Hey HN,<p>I built pg-mcp, a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for PostgreSQL that provides structured schema inspection and query execution for LLMs and agents. It&#x27;s multi-tenant and runs over HTTP&#x2F;SSE (not stdio)<p>Features
 - Supports multiple database connections from multiple agents<p>- Schema Introspection: Returns table structures, types, indexes and constraints; enriched with descriptions from pg_catalog. (for well documented databases)<p>- Read-Only Queries: Controlled execution of queries via MCP.<p>- EXPLAIN Tool: Helps smart agents optimize queries before execution.<p>- Extension Plugins: YAML-based plugin system for Postgres extensions (supports pgvector and postgis out of the box).<p>- Server Mode: Spin up the container and it&#x27;s ready to accept connections at <a href="http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:8000&#x2F;sse" rel="nofollow">http:&#x2F;&#x2F;localhost:8000&#x2F;sse</a>
