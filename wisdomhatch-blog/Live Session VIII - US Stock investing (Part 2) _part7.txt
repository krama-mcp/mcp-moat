==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a mix of personal financial planning, taxation discussions, and investment advice, primarily focused on comparing tax structures (e.g., UAE vs. India), real estate investment strategies, and portfolio management. The speaker shares insights on taxation for US stocks, property investment cash flow thresholds (4% rental yield), and diversification (e.g., Switzerland for wealth protection). Questions from participants cover topics like loan feasibility for real estate, ETF commissions, and handling market volatility.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Tax Efficiency in UAE vs. India**: UAE’s monarchy reduces bureaucratic corruption and simplifies taxation, making it investor-friendly (e.g., lower LTCG rates). India’s tax system is more complex.  
- **US Stock Taxation for Indians**: Indian tax residents pay LTCG (12.5% for holdings >2 years) or STCG (20% for <2 years) on US stocks under the India-US DTAA.  
- **Real Estate Investment Rules**:  
  - Aim for **4% minimum annual cash flow** (e.g., ₹4 lakh/year for a ₹1 crore property).  
  - Limit EMI to **≤33% of household income** to avoid financial strain.  
- **ETF Commissions**: Avoid layered fees (e.g., Motilal Oswal Nasdaq ETF) by investing directly to save costs.  
- **Wealth Protection in Switzerland**: Strong currency (CHF) but limited investible options; consider private banks for global emerging markets.  
- **Handling Market Volatility**: Parabolic falls (e.g., 30% drops) are unpredictable; endure rather than time them.  
- **Personal Finance Goal**: A ₹5–10 crore corpus may suffice for retirement, depending on lifestyle and liabilities (e.g., ₹25–30 lakh/year expenses).  
- **Community Support**: The speaker offers ongoing guidance to students via email/WhatsApp for tailored advice.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
m a taxation purpose UAE is already a cashier's economy there is less corruption right why because it is a monarchy they don't have to go through this bullshit of like you know elections and wasting money and you know electoral bonds and you know taking money like black from people and all that BS okay so for them there's no incentive to screw with everyday life of people okay unnecessarily because then that that will kill like their goal is not to bring more high tea people into their economy and make it a thriving kingdom right so that's what they are focused on so they understand here logo if it's a command is a lobby if it's a command right so it's cool with them so even for example it makes no sense by India will have 12.5 and UAE will also have 12.5 LTCG okay it might happen that UAE might introduce 5% LTCG subsequently at some stage okay if India is having 20 more that's how it might work and secondly in math mother what I'm thinking is and 30 years right now currently running my small business to be very honest so investing or I aim to create a corpus by 40 42 years of age roughly 10CR around and I can retire yeah no maybe I'll do it maybe I'll not do it I do so will I be able to do like live freely to be honest like I don't know it's 10CR enough yeah I would say that right for example my expenses once here because I'm traveling quite a lot I have like multiple fixed cost liabilities like owning a you know property and charjana right where I'm paying rent and all that stuff but if you're not having these type of liabilities you can easily survive on like you know 25 30 lakhs a year it's so which brings you up portfolio down to even by a factor of 5 so 5CR is more than enough that that means and apparently I'm in the second stage portfolio age but mixed rate so 25 say once year if I ever like two one two years three years maybe I don't know about goa real estate so if I try and I search for properties can I ask you for any suggestion just suggestion so I'm always available to my students right so I mean don't ask me that you know how to get it with me explain me like I'm telling you an email right and I'll try to respond to it so that's not an issue right this drop me like a WhatsApp email tell you tell me if you're my student and I'll always be available to help so the number you have like from I'm your and I'm your community member so you both know yes yes yes you can drop okay this remind me like two three times I'm like slow at responding I don't need my phone right as long as you do that I'll respond not an issue yeah thanks thanks a lot thank you yeah sohan avena quick to question so first this little consist about the tax on the US stocks on profit working if I'm an Indian tax resident is it only the Indian LTC LTEGA that is that is applicable India and US has a double taxation avoidance agreement which means that you pay tax in only one jurisdiction which is India just India okay so it's similar to what I would be in on an Indian stock yes but the definition of short term in sorry definition of long term on US stock investing as far as I know for Indian tax resident is two years okay anything above two years is tax at 12.5 right less than that is 20 okay second question I had as so you're talking about phase two is where it's good to start on property investment fixer asset investment so if I'm buying something on loan if there are thumb rule on how much should be the mind with respect to the cash flow yes so see minimum cash flow from your property should be 4% so for example if you're buying a one-crow or property the cash flow that you should get is it minimum four lakhs a year right so in each of them I'm not here right almost 1995 percent of your properties get eliminated many people you know start getting very agitated that there are no such properties like this and all that in India there are okay almost every single property that I've bought meets the criteria it's just that you have to scout harder right so that's one second is that your own EMI situation should not go haywire right for example if you and your wife are earning like a two lakhs and if you are paying an EMI of one lakh it doesn't make sense okay the EMI total repayment should not be more than 33% of your household combined income thanks such a thanks all right yeah so I had a webu account when I was in US I did and bank in 21 can I keep using that account I also had a bank account in US so I think it is okay so like legally I don't know like what if you open if you get to open a bank account typically countries will not close your bank account which is like a loop right so you keep on using it oh there's no harm and second question is we have this Mirai asset fang it be a fang of motila lo swall nasda 100 in the bakery season and I mean they unnecessarily charge you like two three layers of commission okay on the best of commissions a month I they will just screw you on commissions like anything okay so don't just try to keep investing in your hand and it's very difficult to exit these type of stock these type of funds okay I ask because I I kept investing like SIP in these ETFs and it gave like 70 80% returns in last two three years yeah after all it is 40% up okay so apart from commission yeah there is Indians yeah you see it's not motila's magic that helps you generate like 70% turn up you this was motila lo swall nasdaq one so nasdaq itself like that amount of return by going through motila you are paying two layers of commissions which is not required right so that's what I'm hinting at right so I've arrested your fault right now you approach it that's not about the absolute amount of returns that you're making it's more it has got more to do with the fact that it's more more to do with the fact that are you saving like at least one layer of commission and last question I had purchased YouTube membership so should I cancel it for one year and continue on for this okay thank you hey hi akshad thank you for for this course very pragmatic practical macro approaches very helpful thank you I'm in a bit of flux so my residency status has changed to Europe very recently but I do not have cash flow here yet all of my significant portfolio is in India I hear your your your guidance on diversification particularly US and so on what's the best practice for me because if I repatriate then perhaps I'll have to pay a lot of I don't know money repatriating it makes most sense for me to operate out of here now the the the cost structure the tax structures really good as good as yours what would be a good I good good good way so you're saying that in Europe the tax structure is okay for you it's what's in it is seeming okay god it got it good okay so I'm not aware of like Switzerland's tax structure right I looked at it but what's a good way to start to operate from here I do not have cash flow yet maybe soon but not yet see in Switzerland what happens is that it's a great wealth protection country because with Frank it does not go down in value it rather appreciates compared to US dollars it's one of the strongest currencies the downside is that there are not many investible options in entire Europe because it's a socialist system okay now therefore you have to go and explore opportunities in emerging markets now what you can do is that depending on your quantum of money that you're investing if I were you I would figure out a private bank that I can work with that can give me access to more investible options in like Middle East emerging markets Southeast Asia and I would not also US perhaps from here US right so yes so all these options right I'll have to check but I have to take that taxation or so I don't know they come in about the taxation part but if assuming that it's zero tax or whatever right then you know all these options are better compared to putting money in Europe all of my money through is lying in India now and I do not have a cash flows yet in Europe so no one's to bring that money to bring that money to Switzerland right and then invest via Switzerland because the taxation is lower right the other one is you explained about the parabolic fall is there a best practice to not get caught in it I know there may be a is it a day candle or a weekly what's a good way to identify the start you cannot try and see what happens is that if the market corrects 15 20 percent for example right now it's corrected 15 percent will assume yeah you know what 20 percent is other it will and he is not correct then it suddenly falls like 30 percent and then you are stuck in that parabolic fall so just go through that parabolic fall that's the way to deal with the parabolic fall okay thank you action yep Paul Somashya you know yeah good evening Sheth thanks a lot for this great sessions and really we feel very grateful for you this session and kind of a request is that if we have this all these materials in our through the Warsaw Community it will be better for us to learn and ask the doubts and get the guidance further and we have touched this topic taking a loan and investing in real estate makes sense so my in a barium living that area this interest rate is around 8 to 9 percentage household interest rate and the rental yield what we will get is 4 percentage maximum so the rental yield is very much lesser than the cost of capital and so so many of our people also our grandparents will be used to do this kind of things only so it's still advisable because the cost of capital is going to increase because for 20 years of ten years if I'm getting a loan for 60 lakhs I'm going to pay finally at 1.3 crores so no so see I mean that's a complicated topic I can't really comment without understanding the exact nature of real estate you're buying but just broad understanding is that's the real estate grows for other returns on real estate are computed in two ways one is the rental yield that you're making and the underlying property appreciati
