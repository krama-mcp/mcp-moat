SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses investment strategies, emphasizing diversification to mitigate corporate-level risks in the stock market. It contrasts two approaches: a "stop down" strategy (broad diversification across similar stocks) and a "bottom up" strategy (deep analysis of individual stocks). The speaker highlights the importance of buying stocks during price or time corrections, using examples like HDFC Bank, Reliance, and Bajaj Finance to illustrate risk management. Key themes include avoiding overexposure to single stocks, understanding business models, and valuing margin of safety.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Diversification is critical**: Spread investments across similar industry stocks (e.g., multiple banks) to reduce corporate-level risks (e.g., scandals like ICICI Bank's loans to insiders).  
- **Two investment approaches**:  
  - *Stop down*: Broad exposure to similar stocks without deep analysis.  
  - *Bottom up*: In-depth study of individual stocks (business quality, technicals, and survival potential).  
- **Margin of safety matters**: Buy stocks during price/time corrections (e.g., Reliance after a 23% drop or HDFC Bank during time consolidation).  
- **High-growth stocks require caution**: Example: Bajaj Finance at all-time highs may need profit booking due to challenges in sustaining growth rates.  
- **Complex businesses like Reliance demand caution**: Their multi-sector operations make them hard to analyze; invest only at significant discounts.  
- **Business analysis is key**: Assess risks like disruption (Swiggy), pricing (D Mart), or industry cycles (Reliance's oil dependency).  
- **Avoid emotional investing**: Donâ€™t over-invest in employer stock (e.g., ICICI Bank employees) or chase highs without research.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ng right. One big green candle okay. How much has it recovered again 18-20%. The point I'm trying to tell you is that stocks of similar industry work like a herd okay. So for example, if cam recovers others will also recover with it with a little bit of lag. If Kotec recovers HDFC will also recover with it. So why expose yourself to corporate level risk now what does that mean of corporate level risk the stories of Chandakur. Okay. Now private sector banks are typically clean they don't work like public sector banks but Chandakur decided to give loans to her own husband the case blew up and HD an ICICI stock fell a lot. Now for some reason you had esops with ICICI bank and you fell in love with ICICI bank. It was stupidity right as an employee to have all your investments with ICICI bank. A much better way is to diversify by HDFC also access also etc. etc. Don't just take for example, even if you are putting five lac rupees on bank and it's like 5% of your portfolio you want to put it on bank put it across four different banks. Okay. Completely okay. Hedge at every level possible. The more HD you are the more diversified you are the better your life is. Okay. That's what I would say. Okay. Okay. It's difficult to diversify with capital rotation for us because of free speed. How do you recommend I have no clue I have not worked with companies that gave me stocks I created my own stocks. Okay. Hedge. Okay. So I hope that this point is clear right hedging my mind. But I hope that this point is clear to everyone that stocks of similar nature behaves similarly right. So therefore it kind of makes sense to be well diversified right. Back to so this is your risk management strategy right on individual stocks etc. And this is called a stop down approach. Here you have not even del deeper into an asset. Okay. Now bottom up approach means that you start looking at from a stock specific basis right that you go and study a particular stock deeply. And the first key question that you and there are like you know two three major questions that you need to answer. And now this is a class that we will do separately. So I'll not I'll take not take more than like you know three four minutes to explain this because we have a separate class coming up. Here you judge the asset quality right and you spend a lot of time doing something called as business analysis. Okay. And technical analysis of the stock right. So for example right business analysis means that for example how strong is the brand what type of mode it has right will it survive for the next five years. What part of the value chain it falls right. Is it a commodity company? Is it a end value chain company? So there are a hundred different things that we look at. So I have summarized that in it. It delayed 18 points. Sorry. And I'll share that with you in the next class right which is which will form the basis of doing business analysis. For example if you take a look at Swiggy. The central question that you need to ask about Swiggy is that is the company going to get disrupted and the primary revenue stream will the company lose that. Okay. Just a second. Just a second. I hope my internet is back. Okay. So all right. So so that's the bottom line right that for example Hindustan Unilever. What is the major risk that you are taking by looking at Hindustan Unilever today? That it might usually like what is the major risk on companies like Hindustan Unilever, D Mart, HDFC Bank, Asian Pains, Monopoly, large ticket, large size companies. No it's price. Okay. There is no issue with the asset. Okay. These companies are going to survive for the next five years. No. Only issue will be that at what price you're buying. Okay. For example, D Mart today if you're buying at a P of 90, right. What are you betting on? You're betting on the fact that D Mart will continue to grow at a very fast pace. Then you'll ask the question that okay boss it's a large cap company already it is like you know one like 80,000 or something. It's huge right. So can it grow at like can it continue to grow at like 20% CAGR or something like that right. If it does not grow for two quarters then you will get a hit. So when should you buy these type of companies at significant time or price correction. Okay. Something like HDFC Bank will not go through too much price correction. It will only go through time correction. Okay. So as long as you're getting to buy HDFC Bank on a time correction you will be fine. Right. That's what I would simply say. Right. What about reliance? Right now is reliance a great company to buy. Probably no. Okay. Why? Because what is the primary revenue stream of reliance oil? Okay. Petro chemicals almost 60 70% of the business comes from there. Right. And therefore it turned to what it turns to geo which is the mirror image of reliance. Right. Which is the tech company. Why did a money started focusing more on tech? Because there was slowing of growth in oil business. Right. That's a problem. Right. That you know there is only like a limited growth that you can achieve. A lot depends on oil prices. It's as infrastructure heavy business. It's not asset light. So what are the expanding to? They are expanding to high profit margin business. Right. So all those points are there. So I'm not so should you like stop buying reliance? No. But you should if you're buying reliance then you should buy a deep discount. A price correction or a massive time correction. Right. So for example, if today you go and analyze like reliance. Oh. Okay. What will you notice? Right. For example, how much has the stock corrected? Right. Stock has corrected. 23% right. And what is the time correction on the stock? The time correction on the stock is this. Right. So for example, from November 21, the price has remained same. So it's a four year time correction that you're buying on reliance. Okay. Who got wiped out by buying reliance or just keep all of the people who are chasing reliance. Right. If you bought reliance here or if you bought reliance here, man, at its all time higher here, you are at a significant loss. Right. So as long as you are buying some kind of margin of safety, you will always have like an opportunity to sort of save yourself. Now is it a good time to add reliance? Possibly. I don't know. Like so to be honest. Like so it's because see, I mean, it's such a big company. What a business analysis will I give you? Right. I mean, it's it's so complex a business. There are so many moving parts. If I like a Gani Baba come and give you like some random Gyan on reliance, do you really think that I would know reliance business? Right. They have like 100 different operations going. I don't know anything about reliance. Right. So I mean, it's so complex complex a business that I can't possibly begin to understand it. Okay. And anyone who is talking like smack about reliance on like, you know, news channels, Kiaviya Kharilo, Yaskar Stoploss, Yaskar Target and all that stuff, no one knows anything about reliance. It's such a complicated business. Okay. That's that's what I would say. Okay. But as an investor, I know how to invest in reliance. I'll only buy it. Like this is a good time to buy reliance to be honest. Like if you're doing it for a swing trade or whatever, right. But typically this is how reliance has always kind of behave. Right. So for example, if you take a look, this is not the first time, right. People who lost money here on reliance, they deserve to lose money. Right. I mean, because they never studied the stock. If you actually go and study the stock, like if you go and study the history of the stock map, where you're going to see it, it will make more sense. Okay. So for example, take a look. There are massive consolidation periods on reliance. For example, from 2009, all the way till 2016 reliance gave zero run up. Yeah. The stock consolidates. That's the point, right. It's for here. For example, 1000 and 38 to here, the stock has consolidated for the last five years. Right. Now can it consolidate for five more years? Yes. So what should you buy on reliance? You should buy both time correction and price correction. So here, because why even in this range, it would have gone up and down, up and down, up and down. So you got an opportunity to exit. For example, if you buy it here, you can sell it here. This will not happen after five years. This might happen after six months, who knows? Okay. But if you buy it here, then yeah, you have just destroyed maybe like six, seven years of like growth that could have come. Right. So a stock like reliance, you should buy both at a time plus price correction. Why? Because history also indicates similar. It's a degrowth business. So therefore, chances of it losing wealth is very, very high. Everyone gets it. Okay. This is the risk mitigation strategy. Simple points. It's not that complicated. It's not as if that you need to create a complicated setup to understand all these things. Okay. Bajaj finance. What's the risk? For example, I'll take the right hand. Oh, Jauju. Oh, that was finance. Just a second. Yes. This is Bajaj finance. Right. What is the risk here? It is at an all time high. What margin of safety are you buying? Nothing. Okay. So this is a problem. Right. It's in a breakout. Right. So basically like one could argue that you have purchased time direction because it's seven eight six two was the 2021 price. Now it's 9000. It's not that much up given the growth that has happened. It's a high growth company. Why? Because loans are growing at a crazy rate in India. Right. So 48% everyone wants loans in India. Right. So this is a high growth company. But for a company that at the size of Bajaj finance maintaining a 40 45% growth rate is a challenge. Okay. So do I book some profits now? Yes. That's it. Okay. So like will I be right? I don't know. Okay. But like with a firm size of like Bajaj finance, you have to book profits. Right. I mean,
