SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses analyzing a company's growth potential, using CDSL (Central Depository Services Limited) as an example. It emphasizes investigating historical growth drivers (e.g., stock market popularity post-2020 due to COVID-19, zero brokerage models, and tax advantages) to assess sustainability. The author highlights the need to study macroeconomic signals (e.g., India's low stock market participation rate) but cautions against simplistic answers, framing investing as an art requiring judgment. The concept of "margin of safety" is introduced, stressing the importance of buying during price or time corrections rather than at all-time highs. A parallel example of private bank stocks post-2020 quantitative easing illustrates the risks of buying overvalued assets without sufficient safety margins.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Growth Analysis**: Investigate past growth triggers (e.g., market trends, policy changes) to gauge future sustainability.  
- **Macro Signals Matter**: Metrics like India’s low stock market participation rate (2%) can indicate growth potential but require nuanced interpretation (e.g., tax-paying population constraints).  
- **Investing as Judgment**: No definitive "yes/no" answers exist; decisions rely on weighing conflicting signals (Black Box Theory).  
- **Margin of Safety**: Avoid buying at all-time highs; seek price/time corrections to reduce risk.  
- **Caution with Overvalued Assets**: Even fundamentally sound assets (e.g., banks during monetary expansion) can be poor buys if purchased without safety margins.  
- **Real-World Example**: CDSL’s growth hinged on market boom, but competition (e.g., NSDL) and stagnation risks underscore the need for thorough analysis.  
- **Art vs. Science**: Investing and business decisions are contextual and judgment-based, not purely mathematical.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
r 25% okay. Now a good way to understanding whether a company will be able to take growth or grow at the same rate for example here we are trying to run the estimate. See CDSL growth rate is 25 30% okay. Will it maintain this right yes will it not maintain this okay. So what can you now how do you run this estimate right one way or one aspect that I would look for is that I will try to investigate why did it grow so fast in this range. Okay. So 25 to 30% EGR if it generated in the last 5 years what really happened in the last 5 years. So one thing that really happened was 2020 right the stock investing became mainstream. Okay. So basically for people who don't know what CDSL does basically very in very simple words the more stocks are traded. And this is a central deposit tree right so the more stocks you get delivery so this is stored in CDSL and CDSL charges some commission from the broker. So more is the trading volume more people are getting excited about the stock market the better it will be for a company like CDSL. That's the bottom line okay. Now here what happened right so for example here number of users who invested in the stock market literally went like 4x 5x why did it happen because there was a covid push. Number two something like zero that came right and they disrupted the business model on a click of a button you could grow like you know start investing all that stuff was happening. There was no very few alternates to investing right taxation on equity was much fairer right I mean for example LTCG before 2018 was zero when it was 10% and at that point in time LTCG on real estate was 20% but now they are kind of converging everything. So to cut the long story short there were very clear growth triggers right for CDSL or AMC's growth. Now if we have to work with the argument why will you know this AMC business will grow what will be your argument. Mutual funds okay look at IP got this is a guy people will do a site is no having used to invest okay okay multiple things see I cannot give you like a yes and no answer okay so it's called us black box theory which I'll explain in a minute right but what you have to do is that you. What you have to do is that you have to study different signals okay and the easiest way to understand history is to look at the past okay so you can use this judgment to make an assessment yeah purchase these percent say can it keep on growing for the next three five years okay now. For example right now only 2% of people invest in India stock market now if this number goes to 4% for some reason okay now that's a very healthy positive sign something like CDSL will definitely benefit this will retain. But if there's a stagnation right of this then it's a problem okay so you have to run all these analysis right and eventually reach an answer whether or not you should be investing in this or not okay there is no right or wrong answer different indicators will tell you different things and this is called as black box theory for example if you study macro economics one argument you can make is that you only 2% people invest in India's stock market this number will at least double 4% to each I right but then you look back and figure out you know what what. But only 2% people anyways pay direct income tax in India so like you know where will you get like more people who do not pay taxes but have money to invest in the stock market so that's a both positive and negative okay. So you have to like analyze these signals some will be positive some will be negative some will be negative and eventually you have to make a decision of yes and no and therefore stock investing is an art okay it's not like hard science you cannot like assign a value to this okay you have to make a judgment stock investing is about judgment stock investing is not similarly running a business is a judgment okay. How for example if you run a small caranash of the judgment to spend like 5000 to piece on marketing is a judgment call that you need to make so these are small small decision that you make right similarly there is no yes or no answer that someone will give you right mathematically speaking okay. So this is not something that you can nsdl will be a direct competitor right and so yeah so to cut the long story short this is not hard science that's what I'm trying to tell you so you have to run this top down bottom up analysis and reach like some kind of conclusion okay so anyways let me come back right. You have to understand this right that value migration growth rate point of entry so for example here now what is the comfort level that you have for example you say your under judgment key or my name CDSL they clear right and AMC space will grow at least 2 to 4 will be the least people who are investing in the stock market will continue to invest in the stock market. So it looks like an okay stock so now let me figure out my point of entry so I go to CDSL right and then I try to figure out in absolute terms like what and here I'm trying to answer what margin of safety am I buying okay you can either buy a price correction or you buy a time correction you don't speculate now what is the meaning of speculation versus price correction versus time correction okay. So okay so here you go right you look at CDSL now if CDSL was here okay all time high. What are you doing right even for example just let's just discard this entire thing okay this does not exist we are looking at CDSL here okay on whatever like this date okay. If here you are going and buying CDSL what are you doing you're speculating. Okay why why are you speculating because you're margin of safety is zero why is margin of safety zero because you are buying it all time high are you buying any type of price correction no okay are you buying any time of time correction the short answer is no okay. Okay I delete right every investment that you make should have some kind of price correction or some kind of time correction okay on a wood asset because the quality of an asset is always debatable for example some some of you would say that you know what CDSL right now is overvalued some of you would say that CDSL is undervalued cases to be made for both these guys okay. Which means that. Very much as it's only where there is a clear under valuation okay so I mean where for example private bank ETF and all it's clearly undervalued but if you look at CDSL 100 different things can happen for example NSDL right it might take market share away I don't know like BSC might take something away from so for 624 so almost 6 times it has increased rates profits and it has an abrasion here for whatever reason so we'll not check this 2017 made used to be like 4000 crore right now it has gone to 26 as 3 times increased rates revenues okay so 7% growth rate does not make much sense if you look at the profit growth rate in the last 30% 54% okay. So this is there now can HD can access when continue to grow its growth rate at 54% impossible okay I don't know how they were able to grow it. The reason if you just investigate a little bit of macro economics it was very simple and it goes to the theory of money printing for example how do banks make money by giving more loans when do they give more loans when there is expansion of the balance sheet this is what we studied in class 1 okay. So what is access banks business contingent on money printing okay so that's what it is contingent on that if government decides to print more money increase more liquidity banks will benefit because all the money has to be given via commercial banks okay. Now this is a very simple theory for example if you are sitting in 2020 there was a parabolic fall on the index you will say that okay now quantitative easing will happen and back and all the loans have to be given via the bank. Okay we are going to benefit a lot so you will buy it you will buy banks correct in 2020 just a second guys you guys are able to hear me know some issue. Okay so now see what ends up happening is that this is a sentiment play okay so what ends up happening is that see and I'll just write it right for private banks. For example 2020 you saw a parabolic fall on the market right you know that government is going to do quantitative easing which means what that the balance sheet of federal reserve or RBI will increase they will give money to commercial banks like HDFC access codec all that and their revenues is going to increase their profits are also going to increase why because they have more money to lend their balance sheet expanded from this sides to this size why because money printing expanded from this size to this side all the money is going to be a little bit more expensive. So this is the size to this side all the money has to be given via these commercial banks now if you're a genius you will go and buy all the banks here correct okay and this is where problem happens okay that you are buying a fundamentally sound asset on macro economics and this is the mistake that even I used to make as an investor and I made as an investor with HDFC bank also and I learned okay what ends up happening is that you're not buying any margin of safety because you need to study what the performance of these banks was till 2019 okay so for sure. For example till 2020 till the time it happened okay so what is it that I was buying in 2019 on access bank nothing this was almost all time high right from like if I look at a five year window access bank went from 250 rupees all the way till 750 rupees so in five years it tripled in value we're getting what I'm trying to say I'll just write it okay so for example from here to here okay this was the stock was already on an uptrend okay and if I'm buying the stock here looking at the fact here you do correction well right now feds will expand their balance sheet or I started adding access bank here this would have been a worst mistake for me why because I'm buying what I'm buying 0%
