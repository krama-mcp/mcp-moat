SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a transcript of a Q&A session discussing tax optimization, investment strategies, and asset allocation. Key topics include leveraging UAE's 0% capital gains tax for tax residency benefits, diversification for retail investors, avoiding impulsive stock investments, and handling international trading accounts when relocating. The speaker also touches on crypto investing (discouraging altcoin speculation), expected returns for different market caps, and analyzing stock performance during market downturns.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Tax Optimization:** Moving to a tax-friendly jurisdiction like the UAE can allow tax residents to book capital gains on US stocks with 0% tax, provided they sell after becoming residents.  
- **Diversification:** Retail investors should diversify across asset classes (stocks, real estate, crypto) to avoid concentration risk and impulsive decisions.  
- **Fractional Stocks:** Fractional investing enables diversification even with smaller ticket sizes, reducing return impact.  
- **International Accounts:** When relocating (e.g., Singapore to Dubai), explore transferring trading accounts or maintaining them in the original country if tax-efficient.  
- **Crypto Caution:** Altcoin investing is speculative and lacks structure; focus on established assets like Bitcoin or traditional equities.  
- **Market Corrections:** Natural disasters don’t directly cause stock declines; corrections often stem from overvaluation or broader economic factors.  
- **Expected Returns:**  
  - Small/mid-caps: ~20% returns.  
  - Large-caps: ~12–14%.  
  - US tech (e.g., Google, Microsoft): 12–14% in USD terms.  
- **Turnaround Stories:** Even strong companies (e.g., PVR) may face temporary EPS dips during market-wide downturns, presenting potential opportunities.  
- **Learning Resources:** Seek structured education (e.g., technical analysis videos) over gambling-like approaches, especially for volatile assets like crypto.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
you're 50 and let's say that UAE keeps the same rule of 0% capital gains then you come to UAE you become a tax resident here and then you book profits on your US talks you'll pay zero tax so that's these things like so now you're getting my point right I mean you don't need you are a tax resident of India now you will only pay tax when your book capital gains in now right but if you're booking capital gains after 20 years and hypothetically if you're in UAE as a tax resident after 20 years if you find a job or whatever then you don't have to pay any tax so take advantage of that whenever you move here so don't sell it now that's what I'm saying yeah that's all thank you Pranish Kumar yeah hi took a quick question section when you were asked sorry answering a second question 10 rack so more than 10 rack you know having 20 per stocks but I think then the ticket size of each stock goes less and then you know that that impacts the return so how would you take advice around it because my point doesn't so you can buy fractional stocks so you don't have to buy like like in the sense that for example unless you're buying like something like a marf 10 lakhs is a big amount so you know like I mean 50,000 you are putting in every stock also 50,000 up it's dfcv also you can buy so it's not impacting our returns the idea is that it's retail investors should be diversified that's the bottom line with retail investors retail investors can't be concentrated investors we don't have access we have information disadvantage we don't have any information advantage so by the time we act the other last ones to know the hedges diversification okay okay and so you also talked about building patients so I understand everybody will have their own personal journey and attributes around that but what has worked for you in like because of in terms of building patients over time and if you put something I think I think having access to multiple investment asset classes is really important because you'll always feel the urge to invest but if you know about bitcoin if you know about like real estate if you don't want the way real estate if you know what go are real estate if you invest in if you do hedges right and all that right so the idea is that then you will always have something to study right and then possibly like every month you will find something to invest to be honest like so that's the idea okay but if you are only like stuck with stocks then out of desperation you will invest right which is really important thanks um Komal Shika hi actually thank you uh actually I don't have a trading account as of now so I'm planning to open one after we finish this course so my first question is because I'm living in Singapore right now so if I open account here and I'm on a dependent path so do I become eligible for paying taxes on the profits or if I book a profit at all I think you will still qualify as a tax resident of Singapore if I'm not mistaken but you'll have to double check this because the residency means that you're living in that country for x number of days and you're living outside India for more than 120 days right so like a yeah so maximum like in India you're saying for 120 days so I don't think you'll be eligible to pay taxes in India but this is again a CLL question I can't answer this my my my thought process on this is that you are not eligible for paying taxes your husband might be working in Singapore so if he he if he continues to work in Singapore then it kind of makes sense for you to have a count in Singapore right and trade via that because if you bring that money to India then you will have to pay taxes okay my another question is what is the answer this they might be from the DP don't qualify for tax resident if not earning here in Singapore okay so I don't know okay so my another question is what if tomorrow we plan to move to Dubai what happens to the account that I open here that I'm trading I already have invested money in few stocks and everything what do I do do I have to sell and open a new account altogether two options right one is that if possible right you can continue to operate it out of Singapore right because you need a bank account technically please number two is that you ask your bank to move it for example you open it up with xyz banking Singapore right and for in our dbs or whatever and then they would have like operations in Dubai also so you can open the same account with them here and they can potentially transfer your trading account here so like you mentioned to the via that instead of booking or whatever profits they book instead of doing it in India so same goes for me also right instead of booking profits in Singapore in case we move to Dubai I can move it there right you don't need to because as far as I know even Singapore has like 0% capital gains so you would be paying 0% capital gains but again I am not trading out of Singapore I will be opening a company in Singapore soon right so I mean I'll get full clarity then but I don't think that you are again in Singapore you will be paying any taxes right on your US based trading and last question to start with when I open my account how much should I invest how much should you invest start with like at least 30% of your network right if possible right and then take it up to like 60% of your network over time okay any any stock to start with at a early stage index invest google is very good okay Microsoft google these are good to companies to consider now thank you last question I'm sorry last night there was a earthquake in Thailand yeah so my what I was thinking I think it can be a lame question as well but if there is a natural calamity somewhere around the world stocks do tend to fall right so is that no so see I mean stocks are not stocks are valuation driven to be honest like it's just that taking advantage of these type of things the stock whatever like stock operators bring the stock market down okay it's not because of like you know thailand earthquake the stock market fell it's just that because the stock market was already already over valued and there is a earthquake news news will be played out everywhere then you know okay this much amount destroyed the that's time and there was a little bit of correction okay thank you yeah shaka yes yeah so I'm investing basically gambling put my money in altcoins I'm following a thin thin in principle I'm using vinger x tainan corndy cx every each of the exchanges have different altcoins I want to know a structured way of going learning about crypto investing altcoins and I mean I want to double that side considering the market there is newer but I'm not finding something which is structured okay I don't know I can't teach you gambling right I don't myself don't invest in altcoins so I'm an investor I don't need all this jik jik daily you at company prices track carry and all that I mean if google falls like another 15% I'm okay right but an altcoin falls by 15% I don't know what to do with it right so I don't know what altcoins so this is your ticket size is big right for someone who's putting like a 50,000 one like you will put somewhere where it's asymmetry I want to know how I should go about learning stuff this because I don't have so yeah I mean if it despite like my ticket size being big I can just follow like good investment things right why would I encourage you to take like chances it's small tickets right I mean it doesn't make sense right so yeah I would not encourage you to do like altcoin investing and all that there is no structure there it's pure like speculation okay the session and I accept the that she's just want to understand how to draw support lines it will be covering to more technical session I had already sent like a video right where I'd shown you how to do it right but trend lines you go send the trend lines you should but there was something concept with support lines right we know where this is okay yeah so trend lines is resistance and support so trend line means that you're doing a support line and a resistance line right so yeah okay okay yeah just one of the questions so you typically mentioned that small and mid-cap we should expect around 20% return while large cap you should expect around 12 or 12 14% to say similarly what will be the number for nest tech in reverse investing how much I would say between like 12 to 14% in US dollar terms okay okay yeah and the last question in your NRI community which we talked about to cover on the US or other geography also other geographies also so I'll be adding like UAE stock market as well right on that right so I myself am picking building more positions and UAE stocks so I'll cover that right so it's primarily like international investing okay and one last question sorry but PVR we talked about that it's a turnaround story and all but I was also being that this financial the EPS is turning negative again so is there anything which has happened which is in this financial year if you see the TTM number in screener the last column it is showing negative and by good number so is there any bad news there right now so basically like this year has been bad right for everyone right so I mean 2025 the entire reason why Google has corrected by 30% is because the year has been bad right so every company is suffering right so it's not just PVR which is suffering in isolation so is there that shrinkage of corporate balance sheet what is happening and therefore it's a netmying opportunity now thank you okay guys all right I think we are done with questions okay cool awesome I hope you enjoyed this session right so tomorrow I'll see you again right and we will talk about selling class right and MC had a question yes yeah so hi actually good evening yeah so I was following Goodmich Chanda's what is the power value chain what do you say the process of picking a stock they came across this stock called Vartek Vaba so the FI h
