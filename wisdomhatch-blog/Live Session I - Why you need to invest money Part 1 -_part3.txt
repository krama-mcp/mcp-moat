SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses the importance of understanding personal finance, particularly for retirement planning. It emphasizes the need to calculate a sustainable retirement corpus based on factors like inflation, location, and lifestyle. The speaker highlights the challenge of growing wealth consistently (12–15% annually) and stresses the value of systematic investing over speculative or thrill-based approaches. Key concepts include net worth, position sizing, and the 4% withdrawal rule. The text also contrasts different investment systems (e.g., stock markets vs. venture capital) and underscores the necessity of patience and discipline in wealth-building.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Retirement planning depends on location, inflation, and lifestyle**: Costs vary significantly by city (e.g., Dubai vs. Nagpur) and whether you own property.  
- **The 4% withdrawal rule**: A portfolio should grow faster than inflation (e.g., 12–15%) to allow sustainable withdrawals (e.g., 4% of corpus annually).  
- **Sustainable investing requires discipline**: Consistent, systematic investing (like a gym routine) outperforms short-term, excitement-driven strategies.  
- **Net worth matters**: Confidence in investing grows with a solid net worth and understanding of asset allocation (e.g., lump-sum in stable indices vs. high-risk stocks).  
- **Investment systems vary**: Choose a strategy aligned with your risk tolerance (e.g., stock markets, VC investing) and stick to it long-term.  
- **Avoid speculative bets**: Small, high-risk investments (e.g., 5,000 INR for 100x returns) are inconsequential for substantial wealth-building.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
esting on everyday basis so you will have a very clear understanding of and you'll get to see things in action okay that okay why am I buying what is position sizing right how I mean why am I buying like small small amounts right so yeah so these are like basic broad topics if you just want to quickly glance through it what I'll be I'll not be teaching like fnno and all that because that is like a topic in itself it takes a lot of time to teach so you know I mean that can't be done but these are like you know you guys can scroll it at your own time right so this is these are some things that I will teach right and don't be like so like today's topic just keep a note right so these are specific points that I'll be teaching okay okay so let's begin right and I would want you guys to answer like three questions first these are very important questions we work from morning to evening right and we don't have a clue how much money we want to make right so and I can show it to you okay so if I ask you a very simple question how much money you need to retire what will be your answer just or where you know and what does this depend on then I'll tell you okay 50 euros so we have range coming up okay so this is always an interesting question to ask five euros to 50 euros 70 euros we have range right so five euros 20 euros okay so okay so you get to the point right so I mean same question being thrown at people with discretionary income and we get the range from five crore to 70 crores and you're running like a headless chicken from morning to evening with no clue how much money you need okay so what does it exactly depend on it depends on inflation so someone is saying someone is saying current earning times inflation rate you will come up with really sophisticated formula okay now the first thing that I tell people is that hey if you want to retire you the first critical question you need to ask is that where you want to retire right there is a huge difference in terms of retiring in Dubai versus retiring in Sharja okay there is a huge difference between retiring in Sharja versus retiring in Ajman there is huge difference between retiring in Mumbai versus retiring in let's say our tier two city like Nagpur okay there is at least a 30 40 percent difference in corpus itself right so yeah go right so I mean it's relatively low cost it again depends on do you have your own housing or not okay so that's another critical aspect of it right so this is where understanding of personal finance comes into the mix okay so my general advice to people who have a network of more than like three CR two more than like two CRs that peace owner house okay or peace owner realist it it need not necessarily be a house or whatever but at least own some land some hard asset right why because it controls your cost of living okay so that's like question number one right now let me try to answer this question because there is no end to this debate and it really boils down to a few things okay so number one point that it boils down to how much money you need to retire very simple exercise number one step is that you need a big portfolio I would put this as in today's term right so for example three CR at least okay step two is the rate at which you can grow this portfolio sustainably what is the meaning of sustainable I'll explain that in a minute right I'll highlight this word in green okay now for example right I mean what is a good growth rate for this three CR portfolio right I would say that it should at least grow between 12 to 15 percent why because inflation is at least 10 percent for our segment I was again one of the early people to say this like three four years ago that inflation for us is not five six percent inflation for us is 10 11 percent at least okay so you should grow at least faster than inflation okay and third is the amount of money that you're withdrawing from this corpus and can it sustain your current lifestyle now what is the meaning of that right so for example let's say that you grow your portfolio at 16 and your inflation is 12 now what is the difference it's 4 percent okay now this 4 percent is the withdrawable amount from this okay so for example four times three crores it's 12 lakhs this is your withdrawal corpus every year everyone gets how I got this right so it's very simple 16 percent is the rate at which you're growing this corpus of three crores 12 percent is your inflation right 4 percent becomes your withdrawal withdrawable corpus this should at least be 4 percent okay so this this delta right whatever it is okay now you can play around with these figures for example some locations have lower inflation for example if you're living in a city in India or metro city in India the inflation will be higher but if you're living in a tier 2 city in India the inflation will be lower okay so you have to play around with this mathematics and get to at least 4 percent withdrawable corpus okay and then ask the question that hey boss can I survive with like 12 lakh rupees on early basis with this corpus now for some of you the answer will be no by you know we want to party every day right some of you say I'm with you're at the word of an onion so now that I cannot solve for you okay so you have to figure out whether this 12 lakh actually sustains your current lifestyle okay if this 12 lakh doesn't sustain your lifestyle then you increase the initial corpus it could be 5 crores 10 crores whatever it is right and withdraw 4 percent from it now the problem what do you think is the most difficult part in this entire equation the most difficult part is this right growing your capital at 12 to 15 percent sustainably now why is this difficult because this requires a system right it's very similar to you getting motivated on 1st January every month going to the gym working out for 3 hours and by 10th of January you are dead okay so you do not go to gym even once right after 10th of January guess how many you will do this a lot of things okay so the point is that hey can you sustainably do things for the entire year that's where the magic happens it doesn't happen that you're worked out for like 10 hours on like 1st January you know and give the shit okay so that's the point okay same happens with investing investing people make it exciting right investing is not exciting it's a very boring exercise you have to be like patient and all that stuff the point being that there are two types of investors one who do it for the thrill and second who do it as a system right so this course hopefully will help you become a more systematic investor right it will allow you to develop patients right so those are the qualities that I'll try to outline but just quickly explaining you the example right so for example I was speaking with like an architect friend of mine right and he must be he must have a network of like you know 4050 crores okay so he was talking to me that actually you know what tell me like three stocks I can buy in like today's market market correction has happened I just didn't really discuss right then he was thinking what was I last year I purchased like this particular small cap micro cap company right and I made like 100x return on it I said how much did you invest he said like I invested 5000 please okay so like you're at 40 crore 50 crore guy you invested 4000 and made like 100x my concern at worth by addition earlier right so it doesn't matter it's much better to invest like something like you know make like in terms of growing your capital sustainably you have to understand the concept of network and this is the second key takeaway that I will tell you okay so here we need to just quickly come right and do it via simple exercise see option one let's say and your network is what right you add all the assets that you have for example you have a house you have a stock market portfolio you have a mutual fund portfolio you have some gold you add all that and let's say it comes out to be one crore okay now right now for example market is down nifty 50 is down 14% from its peak some stocks like CDSL in Jill one are down 35% from its peak okay and nifty 50 is down how much 14% from its peak okay now let's say that you got like some inheritance okay and you have like you know you got like 50 lakhs of inheritance okay you're sitting in the market right now where will you have more confidence to invest this entire capital here or here option one or option two if you have to do a lump sum okay or you can split or whatever it is okay the point being that most of you will have the confidence to do it on nifty 50 okay because you inherently know that hey that's a more sustainable way of growing your money rather than putting bulk on on mid and small cap companies or companies which are very you know sort of complicated so this understanding this equation right and figuring out a sustainable way of splitting your money between option one and two or doing only option one or doing only option two it's a personal priority it's a personal thing right which I can't comment on but whatever system you come up with you should be able to consistently follow that system for example there is another system which is called as VC investing system for example I have a lot of friends who are VCs and they don't invest in stock markets at all okay their viewpoint is very simple let's see out of 100 companies that will you know if you invest in one or two will become unicorn and that will give us more than like 100% gain right and on our entire portfolio and 90% companies will die okay which is completely okay with them that's another sustainable way for them to invest so you have to figure out as an investor what your comfort level lies okay so I'll explain you my system right over time right I mean as we progress through the course but I hope that you got the concept of net worth and the concept of sustainable investing in the key takeaway is that
