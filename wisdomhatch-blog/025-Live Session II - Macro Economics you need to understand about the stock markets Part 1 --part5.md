SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses the impact of government monetary policies, particularly quantitative easing (QE) and quantitative tightening (QT), on stock markets, inflation, and the broader economy. It explains how printing money (QE) boosts asset prices like stocks and real estate but leads to inflation, which can provoke public unrest. The cycle of QE and QT aims to balance growth and inflation, with governments using tools like interest rates and taxes to control money flow. The author argues that modern economies, unlike during the Great Depression, can avoid severe crises due to the ability to rapidly implement QE. The key lesson is that failing to invest in assets during periods of money printing results in wealth erosion due to inflation.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Liquidity drives markets**: Stock market movements are heavily influenced by liquidity (money supply), which governments control via QE (printing money) or QT (reducing money supply).  
- **Inflation is a critical risk**: Excessive QE leads to inflation, harming non-investors (e.g., rising living costs), which can trigger social unrest. Governments must manage this trade-off.  
- **Tools of monetary policy**: QE involves printing money, lowering interest rates, or adjusting taxes to stimulate spending/investment. QT reverses these actions to curb inflation.  
- **Modern economies avoid depressions**: Unlike the 1930s (gold standard), governments now have unlimited power to print money, making severe depressions unlikely.  
- **Asset ownership is crucial**: Inflation erodes wealth for those not invested in assets (stocks, real estate), making investing essential to preserve purchasing power.  
- **Market corrections vs. gains**: Panic over short-term corrections (e.g., 16% market drops) often outweighs optimism during comparable gains, leading to poor investment timing.  
- **Government reactivity**: Policymakers prioritize short-term fixes (like QE during crises) over long-term structural solutions, shaped by public demand for quick relief.  
- **Historical precedent**: The 2008 and 2020 crises demonstrated QEâ€™s effectiveness in reviving markets, despite risks like debt accumulation and inflation.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
an government going to print next year impossible for us and therefore everyone is wrong about stock market valuations okay including me okay so we cannot guess that how much of this is going to happen this is literally number one reason why stocks or stock market moves up and down right it has got to do with liquidity okay number two thing is that see this seems like a great scheme that you just simply print money increase the asset value everyone is happy because if you are getting like 20 25 percent returns on your mutual fund 20 percent returns on your real estate every year it seems great but it creates a problem the problem is inflation inflation means that an apple used to cost 100 rupees next year it starts costing 120 rupees that's 20 percent inflation your rent used to cost one lakh now it suddenly starts costing 1.5 lakhs and a bunch of people who do not invest in the stock market or assets what will they do they will revolt okay they will literally come out on the roads if they are dying so they have two choices either to die or revolt okay so they choose revolt that's how every empire has fallen so therefore government has to worry about inflation okay and therefore you will see that for example whenever there is a spiking of inflation for example here in 2020 inflation in the US fell why because in 2020 nothing was moving okay so inflation usually in the US is around 2 percent okay but here it was 0.3 right and then it suddenly right a lot of money was printed between here and here almost 20 percent of the entire US money supply was printed between this time okay and inflation shot up all the way till 9 okay this was very high inflation now what would happen if you are sitting on 9 percent inflation the government is expecting a boss now people will revolt right if this keeps on going up like this it becomes a hyper inflation problem so what do they need to do they need to do something called as quantitative tightening which is the opposite of quantitative easing quantitative easing meant what increasing money supply right quantitative tightening means what that hey you know what either you withdraw money temporarily little bit or add the value leaves slow down the growth rate of money printing okay that's what practically speaking quantitative tightening means okay now what happens when quantitative easing is done when QE is done and how exactly is it done so quantitative easing can be done in three four ways right number one step is that you can literally print money for example the chart that I shown you earlier let me just go back right so this chart so this is literally printing of money this is called as expanding of the balance sheet of the Fed okay so this is literally one and this is obvious that if you print money and throw it in the economy via banks cheap loans then all the asset prices be it stocks bonds real estate will go up okay what's number two right the number two way of playing around with quantitative easing is to lower the interest rates okay if you cut the interest rates then what will happen there will be more economic money flow you will say that you know what's the point of keeping every money at 5% if let's say for example every rates right now are seven but if interest rates are cut and brought down to let's say 2% base now this empty will start giving you four so what will you do you will say that you know what's the point of like saving money I'll just go and spend it in the economy or I'll go and invest it in the stock market so this is called as interest rate manipulation or interest rate like you know restructuring whatever you call it okay third is called as taxes so you can move around and play around with the taxes for example if they say that hey tax on FD is 50% what will you do will cut your FD and bring it to the stock market if they say that LTCG on equity is 25% what will you do you will cut your equities and move to some other asset class okay so these are like multiple ways in which QE can be done the objective of QE is controlling the rate of flow of money in the economy okay if and typically it is seen that if I have to just quickly help you understand the relationship between QE the more QE you do the more GDP data will improve it will lead to growth more QE directly relates to more growth but more QE also directly relates to inflation okay everyone understands this these basic points okay so this is very important so therefore our dance continues that QE is done it leads to inflation okay then QT is done side ways movement happen right real GDP improves right real GDP time is bought that 4.5 or 7.5 whatever right that 670 or 810 years right I mean this entire cycle keeps on going okay and then somewhat like whatever additional QE was done it is truly compensated by real GDP increase okay so this is the game this is what they are trying to balance and if at any stage there is like a mismatch between quantitative easing which was done earlier and the real GDP growth then what do they do they do QT right how will they do QT for example recently fed came and said that hey we are not going to cut interest rates we are going to keep it at 4.5 percent we are delaying the interest rate cut by 6 months okay what are they trying to do they are just trying to go in a side ways movement keep 6.5 or come girl let's let's make the world or US work for 6 more ones let's add some more real GDP and then we will see if we want to accelerate growth okay the way to accelerate growth number one mechanics of accelerating growth is QE this is literally number one even in a situation like covid what I was explaining earlier that when it comes to like even covid like situation when the world stops moving does nothing but even if governments decide to print money throw it in the market the stock market will go up prices of real estate will go up even with zero jobs in the economy price of everything will go haywire right okay so someone is asking me is there any data source to check money printed by government in a year just go to public city that's the best tool right now okay so just simply go and ask literally this pressure you will get your answer okay so on an average the money printing rate has varied between like 14 to 24 percent across countries the average comes out to be 17 to 18 percent in the last four five years okay RBI just did QEC that's beyond my bear market is equal to QT okay so that's a very interesting question can we have a bear market now what is the meaning of bear market I'm not saying correction okay I'm saying bear market bear market means or other depression that would be the right term for example 1930s depression why did 1930s depression happen this is a once intense answer to that okay because governments back then could not print money okay the way they can do now we were somewhat on a gold standard okay so what was the real money what was the protection of wealth right so the wealth protection asset was gold everything was gold bagged for example if Indian government wants to release 100 rupee note in the economy they had to keep one gram of gold in their treasury okay or in their locker same goes for the American government same goes to the German government when was this standard abandoned this was abandoned completely after 1973 so people keep on cribbing and crying about the fact that you know what was the this does what do you call it the we will find like a great depression like situation there is no such thing as great depression like situation why because QE can be done really fast now okay 2008 was the first time when QE one and that was quantitative easing one phase right which was massive right the model was already tested right Ben Banaki was given Nobel Prize in economics for this stupidity right to be honest like that that's all I can call it right so it was madness right that he executed this right and it kind of stuck in the market now 2020 the Hader Road map right that we were sitting on highest levels of debt also in 2020 2020 covid crash happened people wanted quick fix right and government pandals to the crowd okay for example in India most of us would agree that in what reservation is bad this is bad that is bad the point is government is theatrics okay government is very reactionary right not only in the government governments across the globe okay they will cater and they will figure out the easiest possible solution right and that's that right so there's nothing that can be done and quantitative easing is the easiest possible solution 1930 like depression will not happen simply because government has infinite control over money printing they do not ask you how much money to print they do not ask you anything important note for you to understand is that what happens when government print money too much it leads to inflation and are you at a loss yes you are at a loss if you're not investing in assets okay that's the point okay so that's the key takeaway and the central key takeaway is that's e and this is a Peter Lynch quote when you can write it it pretty much says that he more money is lost waiting for a correction then the correction itself and let me prove it to you now okay so see for example if you go here okay so let's go to nifty okay so nifty 50 okay okay so this is nifty 50 okay the market from its top just as you guys yeah the market from its top right corrected by how much from here to here right I mean if you look at the entire dip this entire fall was 16 17% fall 16% fall right if you open up Twitter if you look at media channels if you look at anything there was just may ham right I mean there was just the panic was like unreal that this is the end this is the doom okay this that stuff okay there was just no end to do like 15% fall okay now how many times now think of the opposite that the market went up from here to here by 17 18% did you see people dancing yeah or like you know doing like one from here
