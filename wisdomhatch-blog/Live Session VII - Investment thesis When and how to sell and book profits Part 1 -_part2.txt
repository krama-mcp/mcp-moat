SUMMARY:
The speaker discusses the impact of a sudden 25% increase in Long-Term Capital Gains (LTCG) taxes in India, emphasizing how even small tax hikes can significantly affect retirement savings due to compounding. They highlight two main problems: the financial burden of higher taxes and the precedent it sets for future increases. To navigate this, the speaker advocates for smart investing strategies like index investing and capital rotation to generate alpha. They caution against passive investing without exit strategies and stress the importance of understanding different stock types (e.g., cyclical vs. compounder stocks). The talk also dismisses tracking institutional investor actions as impractical for individual investors and encourages focusing on actionable, time-efficient strategies.

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Tax Impact on Retirement**: A 25% LTCG tax increase (e.g., 10% to 12.5%) may require a 30% portfolio expansion to compensate, highlighting compounding’s critical role.  
- **Precedent Risk**: Tax hikes can escalate (e.g., 12.5% to 20%), threatening long-term financial security.  
- **Index Investing**: Prioritize broad market indexes (e.g., NASDAQ, Nifty 50) and adjust SIPs based on valuation (over/undervalued sectors).  
- **Capital Rotation**: Actively booking profits and reinvesting during market cycles can boost returns (e.g., 15–18% vs. 12%).  
- **Investment Universe Expansion**: Diversify into varied asset types (e.g., unlisted stocks, cyclical stocks) but recognize their distinct behaviors.  
- **Avoid Noise**: Tracking institutional investors (FIIs) or news is ineffective; focus on practical, self-directed strategies.  
- **Angel Investing Insights**: Personal experience in selective, sector-focused angel investing (e.g., fintech) can yield high returns (e.g., 5x exits).  
- **Self-Education**: Mastering basics like capital rotation and avoiding overvalued assets is key to outperforming the market.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
I think right. And there was a sudden jump of 25% on LTCG taxes. Okay. Now you say, yeah, as you go, we're at what's a big deal right? I mean, from 10% it went to 12.5%. So what's a big deal? It's only 2.5%. But do you realize how much your retirement or plus has to expand by to compensate for this 25% increase in LTCG? Right. If you do the mathematical calculation on this, your head will spin. Okay. Because as humans, we are not wired to do compounded return calculation. Okay. So this is a lot right. You at least have to expand your portfolio by 30% because of this. Okay. So this is problem one problem. One of two is the precedence. Now what is the meaning of precedence? Presidents means that for example, if you're a lawyer, you would understand the concept better. Uh, that here, because the taxes have gone up from 10 to 12.5, what's stopping it from going from 12.5 to 15%. Nothing. What's stopping it to go from 15% to 20%. What's stopping it from going to slab? Okay. So this is the precise problem that when you get stuck here and you have no understanding of how to manage your finances and understand how to cut profits, restructure yourself. Then 30 years of your hard work, you will work till the year like you know when you're 22, 23, you'll start working in every month, you're working for your mutual fund manager giving them a sip and you have no control about when to exit. And number two, you have no control over. Um, the, uh, the tax treatment. Okay. So I'm not trying to dishon India and all that stuff. I'm beyond that stage. I don't, I'm not a taxpayer there. So I'll not criticize. Right. It's your call. What do you want to do? Um, I had every year I used to pay like crores and taxes. Right. And I was happy doing it till that time. It looked fair. But once your retirement starts to get hit because if you genuinely ask me a question that I said, how much money do you need? I'm trying to retire in India. The answer is I don't know. Okay. Because technically, if the LTCG goes to like theoretical exercise, if the LTCG goes to 90%. Then I can work all my life, create like 1000 crore purpose, 8 to the end of it. I'll only get 10 grams. Okay. Whatever. Right. So that's the problem. So theoretically it can happen. Okay. So everyone understands this. Um, okay. Final point is, so this is something now I'll tell you like in evening class, like having how to, uh, what are like some key things that I will think as an Indian tax resident, right to sort of rework this situation. Right. So I don't want to paint a picture of hopelessness. Right. There is hope if you're smart. Okay. Because money is always made on relative basis. If everyone is making one crore profit or if sargar prints like one crore. Or a person and give it to give it gives it to anyone. There is zero improvement in your life because every one wattage. Okay. So price of everything will also go. Okay. Money is made when you're generating an alpha. Okay. So I hope this point is geared to every. Okay. So okay. Awesome. Now what's the first key lesson, right, is that what I would do. Right. So the first thing that I would do is that I would learn index investing. Okay. What does this mean? We have already covered on the course that what are indexes. For example, right now we are looking at private bank ETFs. Okay. We spoke about NASDAQ. Okay. We spoke about S&P 500. We spoke about nifty 50. We spoke about small cap 250. We spoke about mid cap 150. Right. So all these are primary index that you could consider mine from time to time. Many a times, for example, NASDAQ might be overvalued nifty 50 might be undervalued. So if you are doing that months S.I.P. Okay. So for example, let's say that every month you have to invest 10,000 by NASDAQ overvalued. Right. So don't invest there. And if 250 undervalued. So pick this start month. That's it. That's cool. Not a problem. Okay. That's very important. Number two is you must learn at least the basics of capital rotation. Because what this capital rotation allows you to do. See, think about this way that the market is at 25 K. Okay. And it rotates between 22 K and 30 K. Okay. Hypothetically. So there is an 8,000 range that you can trade on. If you are booking profit here, okay. Then whatever profit you book, let's say that you started with 10 lakhs. It went up to like, you know, 1 1 5th. So 20% so it goes to 12 lakhs. You booked. Let's say 4 lakh profit. Okay. 4 lakh profit. Okay. Now this 4 lakh can be reinvested here. Okay. And if you rotate capital twice in a year, then you can make like, you know, this, this really add like this puts you a category of 15 to 18%. Okay. So let me quickly explain you the difference between like, you know, making 12% returns versus 15, 16% returns. It's not as if that you need to do something magical. Okay. You start making 15, 16% returns on your portfolio when you capital rotate. Second key point or second simple point is that when you don't buy overvalued, for example, if you're only buying some kind of price correction or time correction, automatically this 15, 16% will start happening because you'll generate 3% alpha on the market. Okay. If you do not, if you sell overvalued stuff, rotate it. Right. So this, this, these are like two pillars of investing and this will only happen when you have a range of options that you're considering. Okay. And it is 100% okay. Just to stick to these. That's it. You don't even need to buy like a 7th. That's it. Okay. Here. Okay. And some ETFs in the US, I'll speak about in the evening class when I teach US stock investing, but to cut the long story short, your first step to becoming a good investor is to learn index investing and capital rotation, which I've already taught, but I will cover some more points today. Okay. But I hope that this first pillar is clear to every. Okay. Second key point is that then once you are through these two stages, right. And you want to expand your investment universe. What is the meaning of expanding investment universe. See, right now your investment universe is this. But this is a very narrow universe. You want to access Google Amazon Apple, HUL, etc. Then you have to go about certain types of stocks. Right. So these are 810 types of stocks slash investment assets that you can pick. Okay. Every one with me. Now the mistake that we make is that we don't learn. And this is the hardest thing to learn and investing, which took me years to learn is that when we think of stocks, we think of all the stocks function. Similarly, for example, there is zero difference between HUL and you know, HDFC bank and you know, unlisted stocks and like you know listed stocks or like, you know, SMEs and all that. No, so there is huge difference between buying like unlisted stocks and there is a huge difference buying. HUL, which is a consistent compounder stock. There is a huge difference buying something like coal India, which is a cyclical stock. Okay. There is a huge difference buying a consistent story, which is like, you know, sort of falling down, etc, etc. What we end up doing is that we keep on tracking FII idea. Okay. This is useless. Okay. FII idea is big ticket game. They are not going to send you an email that actually today we are going to buy like 1000 crores of equities. They will just buy it. And by the time you realize that they have bought it, the stocks are already so why are you tracking like FII idea data. Okay. It's just a macro point like tracking unemployment or tracking GDP data and all that. That is fine. But you can't copy trade like FII is. Everyone understands. Okay. Because the moment someone buys it, for example, Warren Buffett sold Apple. Now he sold Apple. He did inform you. Like, I mean, then it will come after news like after two days or whatever. And sometimes you don't even get to know that. Right. So tracking like investment holdings makes you sound really smart. But it's not a practical applicable strategy. So, please now we are like job doers. Right. We have like full time jobs. We don't have time for all this bullshit. Okay. See, you know, CNBC, I was there. And you know, I know signal with boldly and blinding me. Which boldly. Usually there's no point. Okay. Whatever practically you can do. You do that. Okay. There is zero benefits of watching news. I do not watch any news. Any business channel and all that. Yes. Okay. So there is no point. Right. Stop markets are forward looking. I'm an analysis girl. What is it's like running and owning equity in a business and my background in angel investing has helped me. Right. So I've not invested like crazy mode of companies. I've invested in five so far. I had like three successful exits so far. Right. So. One of the companies you might know is went wealth. Right. So I accepted my angel investment in that my money grew like five X on that. Right. I'm an angel investor. Right. So I pick like select companies, right, which I understand the business model of and I do angel investing. So that allows me to get like a. And mostly around finance, right. Because that's my area, which I understand intuitively. And this is something that I enjoy. Right. So I invest in either a tech of finance. So if any of my students are building any company, happy to like sort of support wherever I can. Okay. I'm not going to buy a lot of it in. In credit not right now because in credit will IPO soon. Right. So in credit finance right. It is already a profitable unicorn. So very few companies in India profitable unicorns. In credit is one. And the base company there or the subsidiary company that is in credit money, which is again a solid company. Right. So they are doing well. They don't plan on exiting any of it. In fact, just like an interesting information that Charu Khan and Gauri Khan are also investors in credit money. So they have also paid like angel investment stake. Okay. So whenever like IPO news will come all this will come up. Okay. So yeah. Yeah, you're exc
