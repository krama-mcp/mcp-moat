==================================================

SUMMARY:
The speaker discusses investment strategies, focusing on sectors like healthcare (hospitals), luxury real estate (Goa, Dubai), and high-margin businesses (AMCs, tech). They highlight tailwinds (positive trends) in healthcare due to rising demand and limited competition, the aspirational value of luxury properties, and the efficiency of low-capital, high-margin businesses. They caution against capital-intensive sectors (e.g., telecom, power) and overhyped stocks, emphasizing long-term trends like remote work driving demand for cleaner living environments.

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Healthcare/Hospitals**: Favorable due to industry expansion, high regulation, and pricing power (e.g., Max Hospital, Narayana Hrudayalaya).  
- **Luxury Real Estate**: Aspirational demand in Goa (holiday homes) and Dubai (convenience for Indians) is a long-term bet.  
- **High-Margin Businesses**: Asset management (AMCs) and tech companies are attractive due to low capex and high operating profit margins.  
- **Tailwinds vs. Headwinds**: Invest in sectors with positive trends (e.g., healthcare growth) and avoid those facing structural challenges (e.g., metro real estate scarcity).  
- **Avoid Overexposed Sectors**: Capital-intensive industries (telecom, power) and heavily publicized stocks (e.g., Vedanta) are risky for long-term holdings.  
- **Remote Work Shift**: Future demand for cleaner, non-metro locations as job markets decentralize and freelancing grows.  
- **News as a Signal**: Strongly covered companies often indicate late-cycle investments; quiet performers are preferred.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 so very less work is getting into that so I don't want to buy commodity therefore I don't buy pharma more but as long as pharma is growing it's common to think that pharma will also grow because of hospitals right so as long as you're buying like two three good hospitals max was one of my bets which is doing well I'm not sold anything uh Narayan Hiddale is good right so that's two you have a polo right so that that's again good but honestly like all hospitals are good right as long as you're not doing anything crazy okay so okay uh tailwinds tailwind means that something is happening which is positive okay so tailwind is like this headwind is like this you are moving in this direction okay so this is going up uh downstream okay so downstream means that if you row the boat here right you'll grow row faster but if you have to row the boat this way right then you will slow down okay so this is tailwinds now again the insurance example that I gave you the hospital example that I gave you those are critical products right uh industry is expanding more people are availing uh healthcare they have more you cannot create like another max hospital chain it will take you thousands of crores to buy like prime real estate and good now and all that okay uh cost of capital is now sensible for them there is no dead flag this is happening uh this is also okay right I mean this is always questionable right less prone to regulation yes hospitals are very well regulated already they are B2C type of businesses B2C means directly they charge them customers they are not B2B but they also have a B2B element which is insurance okay so they will tie up with insurance company offer like you know whatever like centers and they have pricing power absolute crazy right pricing power okay so you would have read the case that ventilator you have to leave it right and all that and it's charged like crazy amount of money so there are two stories or anyways there okay KTAS to luxury right so this is where people have money right for example in 2021 Mercedes did its record sales in India okay not getting right so I mean the entire India was suffering and Mercedes was selling highest number of parts in India okay so similarly record luxury sales of apartments in India for example Camilla and whatever apartments are there 150 crores these are look it's crazy because of people have that kind of money in India yes so which they are buying okay so that is there uh so this is anything that KTAS to like luxury segment it's great now why am I bullish on like Dubai real estate and goa real estate why because luxury is what luxury is aspirational if you are in India many of you feel unsafe buying a property abroad right so you will say that Pataniya, Chilia, my property for in land with this that's not we cannot anyways travel they have to be in India so yeah what's that aspirational three tell me like three aspirational locations in India where people really want to right so goa is one okay one could be mountain okay so abhi goa has gotten like a little bit of hate you know tourism this that stuff but tourism is sick like a lever Dubai tourism has gone on not as if that only goa tourism is suffering okay but movies when they start getting made they'll chata and you know whatever like deer's in the gear and all that why were they shot and goa right because of aspirational value right so people want to live that type of life what type of property should you buy in goa already homes okay so holiday homes means what that you already have one house in Bombay Mumbai Bombay Bangalore Delhi polluted cities you want to enjoy peace live in a clean environment you own a holiday room in go okay so you come you spend like two months rest of the time if you want to do Airbnb do Airbnb otherwise leave it vacant okay so that is like how it goes okay so that's aspirational Dubai if you want to buy an international property where would you buy it Dubai in New York Singapore Singapore is crazy expensive if you're a foreigner you have to pay 22-23% time duty if I'm not mistaken so that goes out of hand so you can't buy Singapore realistically speaking New York again is very complicated to travel for Indians from India to US long flight very difficult to monitor Dubai yes because from goa it's a three-hour straight flight to my place do to do it takes me like seven hours it's much more convenient for me to travel from Dubai to goa then from goa to Delhi not getting okay so yeah so Dubai so someone was joking that Dubai is the best Indian city okay so it's actually true right so it's much more convenient to travel that way right so therefore like and Dubai has that aspirational value 50% jump there is Indians okay so it's not getting right so that's how it is right so it's aspirational it's very simple right on a 10-15 20-year basis these two locations are going to do exceptionally well why very simple trends right so I was just studying the housing data right so for example Bangalore to Bangalore means so there is something called as housing supply to population data okay sorry housing supply to population correct so housing supply to population data if you take which indicates that for example if the ratio is 100 okay so which means that for every 100 people there is one house okay so in Bangalore Delhi Mumbai if you study the data the data tells us so this is a tweet also that I've done I just I don't want to miss quote the numbers right so I'll just show you right so okay so this is the data right so you can in fact search for it as well try so so Dubai for every seven people there is one house right and for Bangalore for every one 85 people there is one house okay so that is the level of competition that is there right in like in terms of housing and therefore like the housing prices do not make sense in any metro whatsoever why do you think that is the case that is primarily because of job markets okay the moment the job markets spreads to 2025 cities the type of correction that you will see in like major metros that's going to be unprecedented right so that is going to happen right you will have hard time selling your properties there where are people gravitating to right so like going forward 10 15 20 years down the line what is likely to happen very simple that people are going to live in cleaner environment that the demand is in elastic okay you need to preserve your health there is no other option number two as employment opportunities go online more and more and then a viable way of making like money right for example content creation small small businesses which is their agency model which where we are heading right so even like read Hoffman who is the founder of LinkedIn his predictions are pretty much accurate about everything especially on job markets so according to him right most people would be freelancing right after like in another 15 20 years where do you think that you know the crowd is going to move right clean up environments like that automatically like I mean it has got nothing to do with the Indian government per se you know city even abat the even abat the ins that cities networks hubs will automatically form okay so as and when people are able to figure out these opportunities okay so just think from that angle okay so I hope that this point is clear okay so this is advanced slash slash tailwind concept okay Kitas to luxury this I have explained OPM means operating profit margin okay so operating profit margins simply means that for example AMC business right so asset management companies are great companies to generally own in India tech companies are great companies to own anywhere in the world why because they fear they have fairly high operating profit margin why because they don't have too much fixed cost right they don't have too much too many factories for example HDFC AMC the entire company you can run with five people and move like 50,000 crore rupees every month okay why you have to go like you know five computer lagane five interns but on it and you can move money from point to point we have an office in Russell game right so I have three risks that's it right so I have a team of three in in UAE right now right there's a small office right I mean because my job is money management so I don't require that bigger team but if I were operating like a small manufacturing unit I need to have like at least a stop of 20 25 people okay so therefore these businesses are high operating profit margin businesses right tech money management so these are general banks banks are also okay right I mean they have to have like physical presence in India but generally like money churners are AMCs right are anything to do with stocks money right very low Kpex right and very high operating profit margins okay so I will probably just close the class after this can't take vertical horizontal integration this I've already explained usually not in news for example good businesses you'll not typically find in news okay and this is specially true for like small cap companies so how to analyze small cap companies I'll write notes right I mean there's no point in bringing it up in this course but generally if you are finding too much news on a company for example recently Vedanta with a lot of news I gin solve a lot of news I just avoid okay either you are early in the cycle for example if you bought swiggy pre IPO your money was preserved but if you bought swiggy post IPO you are destroyed okay why because the stock it 600 and now you're setting at 50 percent loss but in unlisted I bought it at 360 now the stock is at 350 despite 15 percent market correction so it's not as if that anything has happened avoid capital intensive businesses like telecom railways power sector they are good turnaround stories they are good swing trades okay but as an investment mine forget three years five there is no guarantee defense right you win a defense contract the company goes
