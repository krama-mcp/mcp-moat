==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses investment strategies focused on market trends, sentiment, and valuation analysis. It emphasizes buying during downtrends (e.g., betting on a company's revival plan) and selling during euphoric uptrends (e.g., small/mid-cap indices after a 250% run-up). The speaker critiques overvalued markets (e.g., Nasdaq at 17–20% CAGR) and advocates for patience, liquidity retention, and avoiding overinvestment in overheated sectors. Key themes include cyclicality, fund manager behavior, and the importance of long-term return normalization.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Downtrend Investing:** Buy during panic (e.g., Google’s downtrend) when sentiment is bearish, and sell on revival-driven bullishness.  
- **Uptrend Caution:** Avoid overinvesting in euphoric phases (e.g., small/mid-caps after 40% CAGR); book profits when returns exceed historical averages (e.g., 20% for mid-caps).  
- **Market Valuation:** Analyze CAGR over 5/10 years to identify overvaluation (e.g., Nasdaq at 17–20% CAGR vs. historical 12–13%).  
- **Fund Manager Dynamics:** Returns normalize over time; sideways markets often follow overheated phases as fund managers adjust to sustainable expectations.  
- **Liquidity & Timing:** Maintain liquidity to capitalize on corrections (e.g., recessions); avoid emotional investing in overhyped markets.  
- **Index Investing Benefits:** Easier exit in small/mid-cap indices vs. active funds with opaque underlying assets.  
- **Behavioral Insight:** Investor sentiment (panic/euphoria) drives short-term opportunities, but disciplined analysis ensures long-term success.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
siness therefore there it has gone into a downtrend and therefore you are buying it whenever Google decides after six eight months 12 months that hey here is our revival plan what do you think is going to happen to Google stock people will become certain the sentiments will become Bursh and you are going to immediately make money on your investment okay so what are you betting on on Google not uptrend right you're betting on Google's ability to build a revival plan and communicate it in media okay you don't give a shative Google survive after five years if you invest today and if it goes up by 50% sell it make your money or whatever right and go out okay so why are you like mad at Google okay so the bottom line is that you bought a panic you waited for a turn around and you stole it okay everyone with me okay so this is the meaning of uptrend downtrend buying it on sentiments okay now let me tell you like opposite case right so far example if you look at small cap 250 yeah now this is yeah I have to use my cap okay now this is now many people are saying that you know what was small cap now here you need to know basic math okay so basic math and ability in fact mid cap because small cap index is not that old and mid cap and small cap indices work similarly okay mid cap 150 okay now for example from here from here like forget about like covid crash okay so we look at it from pre-COVID okay now pre-COVID in five years small cap 150 gave 250% run up okay on a five-year basis this is almost 40% CAs year everyone gets it okay now what is the average CAs year of mid cap companies it is roughly 20% 20 21% so this was almost 2x run up that had happened on it everyone gets how right how did I reach this conclusion because the average CAs year of mid cap companies is 21% or 22% but in the last five years right including covid this was 40% so here can you say that it is definitely euphoric right back in whatever this date is so this is complete euphoria okay you will see mutual funds coming out and saying that you know boss we just cannot take any more money from you okay we are making you know a lot of commissions from you but we cannot take that money okay and you are almost like you know doubling like and they stopped taking money also many mutual funds they stopped their inflows in the scheme and that point in time this is this rarely happens okay now what should you do you should at least book some profits how much I don't know okay but at least some profits should be booked luckily I and I exited all my small mid cap indexes and this is the reason why I love index investing in mid caps and small caps because they are very easy to exit okay otherwise if you buy like Phalanad Incac want active mutual funds small cap or something problem is that how would you exit okay so you don't know like what the underlying assets are okay so here this is definitely euphoric and if you go and have conversations with people in like 23 and everyone was excited about your mid cap right small cap right so I will also go and buy more and more okay problem is that do you do not you should not be buying too much on an uptrend okay when should you buy much of the stuff right for example please check my videos right and there was a time approximately like one minute half year when I barely invested any money in the markets okay therefore I'm flushed with liquidity I have like 70 80 percent of my entire capital of a million dollars which I could potentially in fact two million dollars I can invest so everything I'm aware right in like UA right so like I I'm just waiting the eye to recession right now I'm going to right so another recession right so what would you right so so so that's the bottom line right that you have to like for example this is and clear uptrend right you can see this is uptrend this was one uptrend this was consolidation then there was second uptrend so there are two uptrends that have happened right massive right you are setting at 2x the average return what there should be now what is likely to happen from this point so below the edge are you are doing post-martama analysis what is the future tell me this okay future is very simple that it is likely going to be sideways okay so this is going to be a consolidation or a sideways market for midcaps okay this is not going to give you any crazy returns right unless the returns normalize now what is the meaning of returns normalizing it means that for example right many people are saying that hey you know what liquidity let's say it was 100 units they brought it up to 150 units yes therefore two uptrends have happened right uptrend one uptrend two okay now what will happen to the liquidity the liquidity increase will be slowed down I'm not saying that it will not grow but what is the moral responsibility of large caps fund managers small and midcaps fund managers what is a moral responsibility here they have to give you 12% toughly here they are very happy 20% this is the more that they give right it's like the conversation between kids and parents okay so parents are not going to be anything for example if you take get like 90% marks in 10th okay then if you get 89% marks in 12th they will say you number them guess over them are you know you are you are a party get there they say but if you are a smart kid you will get 60% to begin with in 10th right and when you score like 80% in 12 your parents same parents will give you like metay and you know all the money they will give you so it's like that okay so for example now if you're mutual fund manager right your expectation is that I have 20 20 I have one message I have 20 40% years you are I was saying can realistically like a mutual fund manager keep on generating that return for you on a four five year basis thing from their perspective right because who moves the market mutual fund managers okay you are doing your SIP and it's their job to move the market now let's say that for the next two years now returns go sideways okay now if someone was started there investing in 2020 on small caps or midgaps okay midgaps and small caps give similar returns so let's say let's extend this right that we reach here and till 2018 okay so how many years eight years we make 218% returns so how much is the CAs here almost like 20% okay what do you think mutual fund managers will say mutual fund managers will say that see look at our funds return if you would have invested money in 2020 with us just before covid and if you would have stayed invested in the market with us till 20 28 you would have been making 20% returns now you say that I was a great idiot that I cut my mutual fund does that so I'm going to go like I'm going to go to the right so everyone got this point small cap 250 I can't show because the index started like 2019 or something 2020 or something okay so it's exactly the same you can do it at your own convenience okay and this is how mutual fund so you have to think from their perspective that's he was like right now there is no incentive for them to give you any returns okay even now the returns are over bloated okay so now you're at like 30% CAs or whatever okay now they will take it sideways and that's how they are going to do it on a five year basis now what other measure do mutual fund guys take they look at 10 year okay so look at our 10 year rolling return whatever okay so we'll be there let's go 2015 okay so this is 2015 okay so from here to here it's almost 400% right now it's almost 330 right in 10 years so this is again like more than 25 26% CAs here I'm talking about now almost 26% so still it's like 6% CAs here more on early basis so another avenue for another like you know 15 20% correction okay now two things can happen either there will be a price correction or there will be a time correction other if price correction then we need another 15% price correction fast then it becomes viable or it goes sideways in this market right for another maybe like two years for this return to normalize on a 10 year basis on a five year basis on a three year basis because this is the report card that your mutual fund managers are going to show you okay and this is the only thing that you need to worry about every on with me okay okay now comes Nazdaq okay so Nazdaq is an interesting animal right and it's a very difficult animal because I'm like okay so QQQ okay so here we are okay so let's do the same analysis on Nazdaq now Nazdaq is a tech index now the growth of a tech index in the US in US dollar terms roughly around 12 13% right because this is the rate at which these companies typically grow okay so now if you do like 10 year analysis okay on Nazdaq this is 20 20 okay so on a 10 year basis 10 12% it looks fairly valued okay now okay after this correction so this is five year basis so this is overvalued okay this is like well it means just going with the law or even if I look at the overvalued okay so this is roughly like what 17 18% C.H. here yeah last five years okay is this overvalued yes on a five year basis okay what about 10 year basis okay so let's do that okay at least these two numbers are very important so 2015 we go we plot this this is almost 360 360 if there are 10 year basis case of say Karoge so this was we like again like what more than like 20% okay so this is very bloated okay still okay so the point being that this is not a great time to over invest in the US market okay why because both five year candles and 10 year candles tell us realistically that the market is overvalued and when I say such statements we forget very disappointed here I'm doing yeah gambling earn you really I'm sure right so that is something that I can't do right I'm not teaching investing for entertainment purpose okay if it is overvalued it is overvalued I can't do anything okay go planetary like see them a mango tree grow okay so if you want to time pass okay so now that's better use of your time okay every girl around the bo
