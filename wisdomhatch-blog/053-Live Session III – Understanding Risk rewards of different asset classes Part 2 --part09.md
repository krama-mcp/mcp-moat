==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses their approach to sharing stock market insights primarily through WhatsApp and YouTube due to regulatory constraints in India. They highlight the challenges of obtaining licenses in the Indian market compared to the US, where they actively manage a portfolio. The conversation also covers tax implications for NRIs, sector-wise investment strategies (e.g., undervalued sectors like private banks and consumption stocks), and the importance of diversification across global markets. Additionally, they address queries about P/E ratios, industry trends, and disciplined investing practices, emphasizing investing only when opportunities are compelling.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Regulatory Barriers:** The Indian stock market is highly regulated, making it difficult to provide live portfolio updates, unlike in the US.  
- **Communication Channels:** Updates are shared via WhatsApp and YouTube communities to bypass regulatory limitations.  
- **Tax Advice for NRIs:** NRIs in high-tax countries like Norway can optimize taxes by routing investments through Indian accounts.  
- **Sectoral Investing:** Focus on undervalued sectors (e.g., private banks, consumption stocks) and avoid overvalued or uncertain sectors like IT.  
- **Global Diversification:** Exposure to multiple markets (US, China, India) is recommended due to a multipolar world economy.  
- **Investment Discipline:** Avoid impulsive investing; deploy capital only when high-conviction opportunities arise (analogous to the "apple test" for hunger).  
- **P/E Dynamics:** High-growth industries (e.g., semiconductors) command higher P/E ratios, while commoditized sectors (e.g., steel) do not.  
- **Long-Term Mindset:** Investing should align with long-term goals, irrespective of an individual's active career span (e.g., 12–13 years).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
se I had I just lean by like sitting like HDFC MC as long as you are reading my posts they are on whatsapps last YouTube community we'll get all the information that that I'm doing in the Indian market okay so that's not so though don't miss the post that's the important point he's review it like once every day right and honestly like because we have a whatsapp community the chances of you missing is very low right so because you know I'm like kind of making it very active right so when as long as you have your phone it's not as if that you need to sit in front of your screen all day as long as you read like my one whatsapp message every day it's good to go okay now second part is that can I like do a live buy and sell portfolio thing for my India stock market I can't as per regulation okay I'd like to do like anything in India right now I'm doing exactly that for my US okay so for example I have told that he I'm building like one million dollar US equity portfolio 25% done here's buy and sell on device basis this is where my portfolio stands today this is where market stands today so that I can do in the US stock market not in the Indian stock market as per the law now you say that okay why don't you get regulated in the Indian stock market I'm already trying right Indian stock market is the most complicated stock market to get licenses in okay so it took me like 30 days to get a license in UA US everything and like I'm in India it's a nightmare to get a license right so therefore I can't do it otherwise I would love to create like a portfolio you can see whatever I'm buying selling on device basis create notifications all that so the best I can do is that around a YouTube community slash whatsapp and give you indications that's what I can do right so so I'm probably missing it but then I'm not part of what's up community so is that the community what is correct this is what this class okay I'm not posted anything yet because the life class is going I'll start posting on it from tomorrow okay sure well Shobham Shika hi hi Akshad so in continuation to the question that I asked in the chart so for NRI's Indian government is charging 12.5% LTCG for Indian stocks but if I have to buy US stocks so vested platform is reporting it to the Norway government so I end up paying 40% tax here though but where are you based out of Norway Norway so you're a tax resident of Norway therefore you're paying the US and tax in Norway 40% yeah so the thing what you should do is that you should link your vested account from India so the money transaction should happen from India so then you'll be taxed as per Indian laws you're getting so for example your mom is there right in India yeah whoever or relative right you ask them to open an account and trade via them okay okay yeah yeah okay perfect thanks Shikha Rahul yeah Shikha and then yeah yeah in continuation to the capital rotation thing that you speak how do you identify with sectors the money will come and the volumes will come and see all I can say is that which sectors undervalued right now for example private lines are still undervalued right so I would buy more on max on it right and whenever it goes up it hits the resistance point and sell some of it right then there are sectors which I'm not confident of for example IT now because the long term growth prospects I don't know what's going to happen right so I'm like a little bit ify right now like so I'm not buying too much of it at least leave room for downward averaging some sectors for example consumption auto stocks now those are heavily discounted so consumption story is going to pick up in India right I mean because tax rebates have been given interested cuts will happen so home loan EMI is going to pick up so something like Awa's finances is one of my stocks or something like dream folks and all right I mean always will benefit so it really is like sector wise thing I can't predict where money is going to come next all I can see right now is that what seems undervalued and where the money you know which industries might benefit six months from now so that's the estimation we can run okay and my second question is I'm based out of India I follow I'm a part of a YouTube community also I follow your moves there for my portfolio do you have some some YouTube community for I haven't started building the US market right now but I would be interested so do you have something like that so yeah correct so I use to US yes you can join anyone can join that I'm legally okay like you know sort of revealing my portfolio to Indians in the US market so that is a complete portfolio you can see right from day one right whatever I'm like okay so this drop a note will I do you can share yeah I just want to ask like looking at like 12 years 12 13 years of active job is it like still to go and invest in US market or like maybe even like China market I could not get the question police are you mean to say that you invest for 12 13 years yeah I mean I would be like into active job for the next maybe 13 years or 12 years so from that one of you whether it is still good to go and invest in US market or other international markets yes yes so I mean see it's a diversification play right so I mean you cannot have like 100% exposure to India because the world is becoming multi-polar so previously it used to be a US driven world now it's a multi-polar world Russia is one percent China is another India is another US is another so you have to have exposure across all these markets one could argue right so that's how I'm thinking right so yeah I mean it's probably liquidation point of view or like anytime liquidating the assets is it liquidating as long as you're doing it within the law there is no problem right so for example even if you buy equities in US it's a it's very well regulated and all right so it's not niche okay okay just have to take a look at the taxation how it works and CA is a better version to help you out right I'm not a CA right so just work with your CA explain your entire case and you'll be in a better position right so Bharti so on yeah hey actually can you hear me I can yeah great session so far Raksha thank you so quick question so peace normally are over valued so is it possible that they increase the overall industry P and it's a chance for the other industries to also get a little more valued no so what happens is that sentiments flow in certain industries at certain time for example right now the sentiments are very positive on sewing conductor artificial intelligence machine learning so it is possibly getting the highest ever paid it will get why because the growth rate seems sensible in that industry would something like commodities get like very high P ever no because it's commodity at the end of the day there is just too much competition for steel copper and all that anyone can produce it it's not doesn't require special skills but can everyone produce any conductors the answer is no so there is a company called as ASMR right which gives like a kind of prefabs to Nvidia and all right so now it's some monopoly stock right lithographic thingy it gives right so now that's very hard to produce so something which is hard to produce or an industry which is very difficult to industry which is valuable and where the growth rate will be high will generally come on higher P now some industries go in a D growth for example the classic case study would be public sector minds in 90s right so for example when private sector minds started coming in India offered better customer relationship better services all that stuff and they took business away from public sector minds so the P of public sector banks as an industry shrunk and the P of private sector minds expanded so that was a transition point now some similar stuff might happen on IT industry that last 8 10 years have been very good for IT industry going forward we don't know whether the IT industry will detail its growth rate or not so there is a chance of P shrinkage in that industry right so yeah you have to think about it this way that wherever growth is giving high P to those industries kind of makes sense wherever the growth is not there or growth will go away the P can also shrink for those industries thanks Abhishek, how are you all good now? I'm good too so my question was I'm like 23 and I'm doing some tech job so the pace really good let's say they're being made I can save two legs per month right now and I'm investing most of the money in stock market so the money hits my account and I tend to invest a lot of money quickly in the let's say first two weeks of the month like what would you suggest how should I go with this? I tend to not hold on to the money it's like if money's in my account I'll just invest it in the best practices the idea is that you buy something at sensible price a good asset yes so just don't invest for the sake of investing unnecessarily right that every month I'm an investor right it's not like that for example it's like eat when you feel hungry but in India we have made a system that you need to have breakfast dinner and lunch now studies are telling us that it's not required right if you eat less it's actually good for your body right every health indicator tells you that right so what is the best way of doing it so it's called apple test now apple test simply means that you should only eat food when you feel like eating an apple okay and if you can eat an apple and you become so hungry that you can eat an apple then only eat right so because otherwise the only thing that I can earn in that right and similarly there is no like grace going on that you have to invest so whenever you find opportunities you invest till that I'm you're not finding opportunities save it for two three months right and then see right sir but right now what I'm seeing is there are a lot of opportunities in the market so I tend to be like overly jealous into thin
