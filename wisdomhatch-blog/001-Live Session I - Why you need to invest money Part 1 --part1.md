SUMMARY:
**  
The transcript is from an introductory session of an investing course led by an instructor with a background in finance, entrepreneurship, and hedge fund management. The instructor outlines the course's value for beginners, intermediate, and advanced investors, emphasizing practical, hands-on strategies for managing money, creating investment theses, and understanding macro-investing and valuation. Key themes include the importance of tax-efficient investing, capital rotation (vs. SIP-only strategies), and diversification, particularly into low-tax jurisdictions for high-net-worth individuals. The session also introduces the concept of "arbitrage" in investing, such as leveraging tax differentials across countries to optimize returns.

==================================================

 Hi everyone, I hope you can see me here me if yes very quick comes up and then we'll start. Okay awesome alright. Okay so people are still joining in right so I'll just wait for like a few seconds right and then we will start. Okay alright. Okay guys so first and foremost thank you for you know giving me a valuable time. Money is like separate right but time is of limited quantity so giving your time over like four days that's that's the most critical commodity that you have decided to give me. So I'll try to respect that I'll try to add a lot of value and I'll try to teach in the best possible way I can right now people who have joined the course right and who do not know about my background. So I don't know like I'm enjoying the course to begin with but I'll just quickly explain you my background right so I used to work as a management consultant with BCG Dalberg which are top tier consulting firms. And I was in their financial inclusion practice right at Dalberg so my background is in finance. I cleared like two levels of CFA never wrote the third one right and now then I like you know sort of have built companies have sold one of my companies to buy Jews right so. Now I can reveal the name right so not a problem so yeah so my background is finance and entrepreneurship currently I run a hedge fund in Dubai right so that's where I recently moved last year right and I started setting up my business. So that has given me like a perspective of managing money as well right so that's about my background and not be labor too much and waste class is time right to request right one is that many of you might be. Attending these type of classes after I don't know 20 30 years so please try to keep your phones away if possible right and second is that please start the cameras right I'll not bore you right whatever I teach it will be practically driven it will be based on my strategies of investing my own money. Yeah so it's going to be highly practical so I'm an industry practitioner I'm not like someone who just says I don't know what I'm investing my money or and then I invest via some PM so I manage my own money significant wealth has been invested through me right so I'll share all those practical experiences with you okay so that's the agenda right and. Before we begin right so just couple of quick notes right so one is that who is this course useful for right and and what is the R.Y. of the course right so that's very important for you to understand right and the R.Y. depends on what stage of investing you are in. So for example if you are a completely new person in the stock market and if this course can help you buy your first stock by. First stock so that adds value will it add value immediately no but possibly like after one year right you will become better right so all of us will go through an investing journey right and this journey is continuous right so even I'm going through that investing journey. Despite investing a lot of money right so every day you improve as an investor and this course gives you like a good fundamental base to start investing money and start managing money on your own okay second key value add for a new person would be that you will at least have a sense of something called as investment. Theses now investment thesis simply means that okay you are buying something right and you don't know why you're buying and suddenly it corrects like 30% now some of you would panic some of you would not panic. People who do not panic have an investment thesis and they do not sell that stock or that asset unless that investment thesis changes okay so yeah so how to develop that this will be like second critical value add from my side okay third is that for example many of you. You might be investing 0% money in stock markets right now right 100% might be on real estate or you might be investing 0% money on direct stocks okay all money on mutual funds only okay some of you might be having 0% international equity holdings right so not investing any money outside India now if I can help you move this needle right so again I'm writing the word move this needle then I have done my job okay so this is for beginners okay. Now if you are someone who is at intermediate stage now then what part of the course will help you number one I will teach you something called as macro style of investing right macro style of investing what does that mean etc I will get later into the the sessions but the idea is that I tell you like broad level stuff right how to do top down analysis and bottom up analysis I'll teach you both type of analysis and then it will at least introduce you. So what macro style of investing is how to become a better macro investor that's one second is that you will get a sense of valuation of a company right so for example let's say right now HDFC bank is trading at 750 rupees now how to calculate the risk reward equation right on that so that's called as valuation exercise so I'll teach you a little bit of that right so that's important so at least I'll tell you my side of the story is rotating capital now this is extremely extremely important and this is what I do and I have been advocating for the last one one and a half two years that rotate capital do not simply do SIP rotate capital now people have started to say this okay so I have been quite vocal about this fact that SIP forever and dies strategy does not work so this is third okay now then comes the third type of investors these are like you know advanced okay and these are typically people who are invested like more than five six crore of their own money and with experience there is no substitute to experience okay so that's that's just what you need to go through in order to become like an advanced level investor it's not about how many years of experience you have it's about what percentage of your net worth you have put in the stock market okay so that's more important concept that I'll teach up sequently so for these guys right I mean you know how to tax structure properly right I'll at least introduce you to this idea. How much of your wealth should you diversify outside India so all these points all these are practical driven things that you need to understand now I'll say that okay I've paid like whatever like 20,000 to piece for this course etc can you help me save money so I'll help you save money on all three okay so like in the first five minutes of the course okay now here is an example I'm a tax resident of UA and I am investing money now if I invest money in the US market on short term basis long term basis for example I buy Google stock today and if I if it goes up by 5% I book profit so I bought it at $100 and I sold it at $105 I made $5 gain how much tax do I need to pay in the US or in UA anyone any cases zero okay so short term zero long term zero if I sell covered calls if I sell any kind of hedging strategy how much tax do I need to pay the answer is zero okay so let's go back and let me first and foremost I'll be make that 20,000 okay so in the 5 first 5 10 minutes of the course okay so if you look pushing you know what is the ROI of the course I'll just quickly tell you right for each of these three categories okay so for example here right if you are sitting on a 5CR plus portfolio okay what should you do you should move to a low tax economy okay where the capital gains is zero now how to do that we will understand subsequently but at least I'm introducing you to that idea because if imagine this right that if you are like I mean you might be 30 and you might be doing SIP or whatever for the next 30 years and let's say that you build like a 10.15.20.20 portfolio okay what will you right so that's not a big deal what was the capital gains tax and 2018 long term capital gains tax 2017 in India and you know zero okay what was the capital long term capital gains tax in 2022 or 2021 like so it was 10% okay now what is the capital gains today long term capital gains on equities 12.5 now the interesting question to ask is that you are 30 years old today it's 20 25 in 20 55 because you are SIP okay or you are mine and forever holding it in the Indian market can anyone tell me with guarantee what the LTCG on Indian equity market will be so if you are already the first key takeaway and I will always speak in key takeaway terms that the first key takeaway of the course even before starting is arbitrage okay this is an arbitrage arbitrage means China import story that you buy a holy pitch carry as a trader in India at 100 rupees and sell it in the market at 150 that's a pure arbitrage right so all cost inclusive and all that you're making like 50 rupees okay so the biggest arbitrage right now and investing is and this no one will tell you because they will get screwed right if someone starts telling all these things publicly and your CBI advisor will not tell you your you know mutual fund advisor will not tell you because what is there go there go is to keep money in India okay so this is a problematic thing because this information is also is not out there so the first key point that I'll tell you because I see a lot of experience people on the call that if you are already in that 3 4 5 CR ticket range and all your portfolio is stuck in India and your investing big ticket amounts what's the first key arbitrage that you've to explore this may 100% of the way so I'll say that right I mean at 100% you will say you money is go to a low tax low capital gains tax economy everyone with me okay this has got nothing to do with investing but at the same time it has got everything to do with investing because over time it can save you cross okay that's one okay number two point right what about like okay fine we don't have like this much big portfolio we invest
