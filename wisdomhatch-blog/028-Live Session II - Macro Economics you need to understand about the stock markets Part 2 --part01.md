SUMMARY:
**  
The transcript is a live session discussing macroeconomics and stock market strategies in India. The speaker emphasizes that Indian markets won't always rise indefinitely and highlights the importance of understanding inflation, risk-free rates, and asset growth. Key points include the dangers of holding cash in high-inflation economies, the limited utility of fixed deposits (FDs), and the benefits of alternative investments like gold or land. The speaker also explains market corrections (price vs. time corrections) and stresses the critical role of entry points in stock market investing. Examples from historical market trends (e.g., 2008) illustrate how poor entry timing can lead to losses, while disciplined profit-booking and strategic averaging can mitigate risks. The session concludes with the speaker's current focus on building positions in US stocks at discounted levels.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **No perpetual market rise:** Indian markets won’t always go up indefinitely, and long-term certainty in investing is unrealistic.  
- **Inflation impact:** High inflation (e.g., India) erodes cash value, making investing or alternative assets (gold, land) essential.  
- **Risk-free rate dilemma:** FDs in India often yield negative real returns (after tax and inflation), unlike in low-inflation economies like the UAE.  
- **FD utility:** FDs are best for short-term liquidity or "iteration money," not long-term wealth growth, especially for secure earners (e.g., government employees).  
- **Market corrections:** Price corrections (sharp drops) are manageable, but time corrections (prolonged sideways movement) can hurt portfolios if profits aren’t booked strategically.  
- **Entry point critical:** Investing at market peaks (e.g., 2008) can lead to panic selling, while disciplined averaging and buying at discounts (e.g., current 10–13% dip in US stocks) improve outcomes.  
- **Sector overvaluation:** Booking profits in overvalued sectors (e.g., defense, railways) avoids steep losses during corrections.  
- **Behavioral discipline:** Avoid FOMO-driven investing; psychological resilience depends on entry timing and profit-taking habits.

 Okay guys, I hope you guys are back. All right, I hope this is not very taxing right? What is a taxing? I don't know, so yeah, okay. All right, so, all right, so let's start with three questions, right? And this would be like a quick sort of pause here, right? Question number one, will the Indian markets forever keep going up? Now see, in investing, we all love certainty that, you know, okay, just tell me like one golden rule of investing. I'll just follow that and forever like till that day I die, I'll just follow that and there's nothing, okay? There is no such thing as forever, but at least for a foreseeable future. Three five years, that's the maximum foreseeable future or anything. It doesn't look like it, right? The Indian market will securely go down. Okay, that's the idea, right? Which would give you comfort to invest for three to five years? Me on that, we don't know. What if you don't invest in these three to five years? What happens to your wealth? As I was saying early, like come in in the morning session, that India, certain economies in the world, for example, India, okay? It is a high inflation economy. Okay, now what is a low inflation economy? For example, Japan is a low inflation economy. Okay, US is a high inflation economy. So the point being that if you're living in a high inflation economy and you're not investing, okay, or you're sitting on too much cash, the value of that cash goes down dramatically. Okay, that's problem one. Problem two is that you need to understand the baseline or like, no, risk-free rate of growth of your asset. As I was telling, for example, if I do FDs in India, okay? The problem is that I'll do the FD at 7%. After tax, after tax, I'll make 5%. Inflation for me is 6%. At least, like even official. So minus one, I'm anyways making. Okay, in UAE, my risk-free rate is that I'm doing an FD at 4.75%. I play zero tax, okay? Inflation for me is 2%. So I'm making a plus 2.75%. The delta is 3.75% at least. Okay, so here I have an option of RF, okay? But here I don't have an option of RF. So by default, I have to take risk with my money. Can I solve that equation for you? No, I can't. What you can do instead in India, rather than keeping money in cash. If you're not comfortable right now, for example, if you feel that you know what market is like all-time high, for example, here, if you're looking at the market, let's say here, I'm in the market, okay? For example, you are looking at the market here, right? On the 8th member, it's at all time high, okay? And you're feeling a little bit if you need to do it or not. What is it that you can do? Simplest thing. What can you do with your spare money? Buy gold, okay? I don't know anything about that. This simply buy gold, okay? That's okay. Still, right? Buy land, if you do, like, you know, when if you don't, like, liquidities an issue, but all these things are still better wealth protector, rather, or they are like the new RF rates in India, okay? So that's much better to do, okay? What's the utility of FD? Again, I keep on stating that it's iteration money. So for example, if you just don't consider, if you're not considering some money as investment, if you're in a high risk job, then having some FD kind of makes sense. But if you are in a very safe job, for example, government employees, I meet, job be safe, right? And 99% wealth is logged in FD. So that's horrible, okay? That's as bad, okay? So there's no point in doing that, right? So the FD money just simply gives you iterations, and it allows you to run experiments, okay? That's two. You know, third point, right? Okay. So market goes up in QE also. Market goes up in QT also. Then why not buy and forget? That's a very good question. Because what happens is, there are two types of corrections in the market. One is called as price correction, and one is called as time correction in the market, okay? Now what is price correction? So for example, the market was going up like this, okay? It hit like 26,500. Then it corrected 15%. It reached like whatever, 22,000. This is called as price correction, right? Now, this is not something that most of us, this is not where you will make a loss, okay? As long as you're investing here, again, okay? Whatever new money you are getting. The problem that happens is that market sometimes move in a range. Like this. And if you're not booking profits here, and you're not buying more here, you are just simply on random dates putting money, randomly, right? Wherever the market is. That can lead to significant time correction on your portfolio. Okay? That's a point, right? For example, in this current fall, if you would have sold your small caps before the fall, did your portfolio correct much? Just a for example, I made a video where I analyzed my portfolio after 15% fall. So you can check that, right? There are some things on the way, right? So why? Because I sold small cap 250 before, right? So I was very little on small caps. But if you would have bought speculative stocks like defense, railways, all that stuff, then some stocks corrected by like 45% also. De-mart, all that stuff. If you did not book like profits on cam, CDSL, all those type of stocks, then again, it was an issue. So the point is that whenever you start understanding that is some sections in the stock market are overvalued, book some profits. If you're not doing that, then your CHGR will suffer. And that's the game we have moved on to. The sooner we get it, the better it will be. Okay? Why? Because there is massive time direction on markets now. Okay? So let me explain that also. And let's go to 5050. See, there are phases in the market when the market corrects. So market goes sideways. Okay? Now let me explain that. Okay? Now we're moving all this. Okay, so let's go from 2008 onwards. And let's look at it on monthly handle. I think that will make more sense. Okay. Okay. So I think this is a good shot to analyze, right? And here, for example, if you are one of those people who chases the market. Okay? When everything looks high, you start investing because you are a FOMO investor. Okay? So what would have happened that when did this market level recover? This recovered after 10 years, right? So 2007, say 2014, but this was a side-based market. Okay? If you would have done a lump sum at. Okay? If you would have done a lump sum here. One crore, the value of this one crore would have been here. Okay? Now the problem is, let's see, we typically do not invest like this. That okay, one round of investment done here. And we keep on holding it forever. What would typically happen is that if you did one crore here, market falls by 20%. Your portfolio is minus 80 lakhs. So you are at a loss of 20. You'll say, okay, you know what? Markets of AAPS are coming. Then it goes to like 60 lakhs. Again, there is no such thing. There are a lot of big things. There are a lot of small things. And all that. So in two-three films, I will log right. By the time you did it, like 30 lakhs, one crore, 30 lakhs, you are out. You will book like 70 lakh profit or 70 lakh loss and you are out. Okay? Why did this situation occur? Because you started investing. Your first bulk or your entry point on the market was very high. Okay? You make money at that time. So this was a very good, you know, quote that was given to me my season real estate investor. That you make money in real estate at that time of entry, not at the time of exit. Okay? And which is absolutely true. That somewhat applies to the stock markets also. That for example, if you entered here and you start seeing losses like here, here, here, here, you will not have the courage to hold your portfolio. Okay? Because your entry was really bad. But if you would have invested in an average market, for example, in here. When you're not investing in a peak. Okay? So for example, let's say, where is. So three types, right? So one is peak. So we have analyzed the speak. For example, this is a peak. Okay? This is a peak. This is a peak. This is a peak. Okay? This is a peak. This is a peak. Okay? This is a peak. This is a peak. This is a peak. Okay? These are peaks. Okay? But if you invested here, now what was the situation like? How would you react psychologically speaking? Here, you made 21% profits first. Okay? And then you lost like whatever like 18% money again. Then you could have potentially downward average rate or something of that sort. So your entry point becomes really important, right? So I hope that this first point is clear to everyone that your point of entry on stock market is absolutely critical. Otherwise, most of us will book losses and go away. Or we will not have the courage to downward average it. Okay? Now, how do you relate it to 2025 right now? Now, what is your point of entry on the market right now? It is still 10% down. Okay? Bagi is up. Leave it. But at least it is like roughly 10, 11% down at current levels. If you literally right on Monday, if you go and invest in the market, you're probably buying the market 10% cheap. And how would you define the entry point? Right? Is it expensive? Is it average? Is it low? Now, see, I don't know if it is expensive or not average, we I don't know. Low is, I don't know. It definitely is not low. Maybe it is somewhere between this and this. So at least like 60, 70% of my capital should be there. Stock investing is a broad investing game. Stock investing is not a specific investing game. Okay? So I hope you got the point that your entry into the stock market is absolutely critical. For example, I am right now building positions on US stock markets. Okay? So I'll quickly show you. So what is my entry point on this market? It's 12, 13% down. So if I have zero investments in the US stock marke
