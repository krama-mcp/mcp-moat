SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a discussion on various investment-related topics, including brokerage fees, investing in international vs. Indian markets, unlisted stocks like NSE, the limitations of AI in stock picking, capital rotation, and the importance of a long-term investment approach. The speaker emphasizes the need for fundamental analysis, cautions against relying on automated tools, and highlights the growth potential of Indian markets compared to saturated markets like the US. Specific advice is given on handling losses, the risks of unlisted stocks, and the value of patience and education in investing.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Brokerage Fees:** Zero-discount brokers offer lower commissions, while traditional brokers charge more for personalized services.  
- **International vs. Indian Markets:** Indian markets (e.g., Hindustan Unilever) may offer better growth potential than saturated international markets (e.g., Unilever in the US).  
- **Unlisted Stocks (e.g., NSE):** Investing in unlisted stocks requires a long-term (3â€“5 year) horizon, as they may take time to list but are often low-risk due to government backing.  
- **AI in Investing:** AI tools can assist research but cannot replace human judgment, especially in understanding sentiment and portfolio alignment.  
- **Capital Rotation:** Frequent trading can erode margins due to taxes and fees; tax-efficient strategies (e.g., becoming a UAE tax resident) may help.  
- **Education & Patience:** Investing success relies on continuous learning, fundamental analysis, and avoiding shortcuts. Losses should be managed strategically, not impulsively.  
- **Market Psychology:** Understanding investor sentiment and matching investments to personal goals is crucial, beyond just automated signals.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
f you're going to zero discount brokers like zero the upstarts grow these are called a zero discount brokers so here the commissions that you will pay are the least if you go with hdfc securities if you go with e-dilwise etc then they typically charge you more because they are helping you in a personalized manner so to say so the charges are much higher right so if you go via any bank right the charges are higher right that's the thing thank you sir thank you no thanks yep the nish monashaji yeah hi action so my question is like you shadow views on actual things right so these companies like international companies which is listed in India like actual him to earnestly all these companies is taking some percentage of the money outside of India as the part of royal taste right so is it better to take some positions in international markets rather than being taking this position in India what do you know so for example you never is a parent group company of industinian level now you never get as primarily in the us now in the us the population itself is shrinking okay and on top of that there is 100% penetration of these type of products so the growth rate of you know level is very slow in the us there is no point in investing in you know level compared to industinian level which is the india specific which is here the growth is increasing right I mean the income levels are rising right on per capita basis etc so it's not a saturated market so to say okay in the us the growth is coming from tech not from domestic consumption yep thank you all right monashaji you know on the nse stocks I believe sebi has put some delay on it and they have kind of said that it's going to be further delayed by two years and you know because there's some discrepancies so the reason I'm asking you is because I'm about to buy some of the nse listed squares so I mean you know listed shares so I want to know whether I mean is that an issue or should I wait like you know will the price you know correct sure or you know should I buy like in batches or I don't know how to get about this right good question so honestly like whenever we are buying unlisted companies we are already going with the intent of holding them for a long term at least we have a five-year plan on it right the reason is very simple that a stock like nse will not come to the market and not run us okay so it is going to run up it's very common sense because people will say it's a monopoly stock government so they will anyways chase that right so and especially after like l i c ipodibacle right where the price corrected downwards government is now very careful right you have to think from like their point of view also they cannot like bring like public companies in the market where retail investors are taking a loss okay so honestly like they just have to launch it at a proper time if you're buying unlisted are there chances that you will you know the stock will correct maybe a little bit right but not much to be honest right can the ipodible delayed by two three years yes there's a high chance that might happen if you're not comfortable with holding nse and unlisted space for two three years and don't buy okay so final is investment thesis on that right so i mean just invest like maybe 30 40% of money now whatever you want to invest hold it for three four years it's a solid company monopoly company in our industry which where the profit margins are huge okay BSEs and examples it will get pegged to BSEs stock performance so from that angle right i mean the risk is kind of justified but yes i mean you need to have like a three four year viewpoint on it there is no red flag to be honest like i mean it's a government company like i mean what scam but they do right so honestly like it's it's it's the risk is low right and it's it's they are very conservative right okay thank you yeah Parish shikha hi actually the 20 20 points which you are taught to pick up the stock is i mean it's very helpful so one question i mean recently started using ticker tape and some other websites they have some screen as like 52 week low and 52 week high and there are some pro screen as like moment on stress and some nearing break out so believe it help us i mean i didn't buy help us to like save some time and is it recommended so problem that happens is that they lump all the stocks together right for example the way you would buy something like noama is a very different stock compared to Asian paints Asian paints is a very different stock compared to indigo paints right which i explained right that for example it's completely okay to buy like you are buying Asian paints because sorry you are buying indigo paints because they're expecting the market cap to go 3x you're buying Asian paints because you believe that the company is going to make consistent cash flows and give you 15% CGR so the investment thesis on both those stocks is very very different okay so please wait for the last tomorrow this will get more traffic okay okay okay okay so you cannot automate stock investing i've tried doing it okay so it doesn't work just to pick the stocks there will be list so many right just to go through the mind to some fundamental analysis before going through them but there's a simplest way you can do it you have to apply human brain power here trust AI can help okay so i'm helping you integrate like AI with like you know basic structured framework thinking it's got it thank you well analogy yes thanks for the insightful thank you you're giving my question is basically there are reference to capital rotation yes i mean if you do multiple capital rotations yeah we tend to end up in a margin erosion due to taxes and brokerage fees yeah so what is what's your take on that do do do cap become a UI tax resident and do capital rotation us you'll pay zero okay close to zero percent tax okay so that's one okay that's generally the second question is basically I mean you you know you keep giving the commentary when to buy and when to sell yes but I think we sometimes we tend to miss out on the buy signal the sell signal is there any way that you can you know specify your stock especially with the US the US stocks uh you know i anyways will post it on whatsapp right so whatever I'm doing right so that's just keep a track of whatsapp channels second is that I'm hoping that after this course you will have you will develop the acumen to do the analysis yourself but at least we'll get more confidence and if you read like my commentary for the next one on the whatsapp channels then it will give you more fundamental insight right because the goal the course does not stop like tomorrow right I mean then you know we'll stay active for like 365 days on the group and then yeah and that itself will add like a lot of value and practice over time right so there is no shortcut to learning investing right I mean it will only happen with time thank you yeah thank you yes thank you so I just want to ask that currently I'm on 30% lost on my investment and more please talks are from finance finance background means so it's like that so shall I read with book the lost and reinvest in another stock or please wait tomorrow please wait till tomorrow I'll talk about this how went to sell okay thank you thank ah Ghanchan Rajesh. So an extension to the AI question so currently there are a lot of tools in the markets which are sort of claiming that they will give us the recommendations for stocks based on some AI analysis and AI is real right I mean AI is definitely going to have profound impact on many areas of our lives so I mean would those tools really be of any help or it's good for research I mean you cannot make like you can't automate it AI will automate things okay so for example faster view editing it's a computer program right AI can't factor in human element right for example most of the stock buying selling will become sentiment driven then you have to understand the psychology of buying and selling right that will be more important right having your matching it to your portfolio is more important so how will it give you like personalized advice looking at your portfolio that's going to be a challenge even when AI asks you to explain your investment thesis and if you're an uneducated investor how will you explain it right so I mean that's a problem it's like you going to an investment advisor right now an investment advisor asks you to tell me your goals of investing I'd say like goals but I'll tell you what's right so just tell me like where my money will double right that's a simple thing that you will say so the point being that without being like an educated customer you can't use AI AI will help educated investors AI will not help like dumb investors I mean it's sort of a phobia if we don't use those tools would be like behind nothing like that I mean honestly like I don't even know about those tools like leave it right on YouTube okay yeah she fell on the action my actions are actually like my two years say I'm in investment so the rest of your points of the regular shares that you consider I'll be able to listen to a lot of things but I'm basically here my next question is not it's about this session I'm in the first time understood her so I'm just shares so I'm just sharing so I'm just sharing so I know most of this is all NSC but I'm generally saying how do I do it I'll cover this right I'll cover this tonight or tomorrow maybe like so try it I'm mostly I'll cover it okay thank you okay okay yes action thank you for the time I've been following you for the last couple of years and I have been able to understand the investment part of it the problem which I'm facing is capital rotation in the last one year I've specifically done a few attempts now for example I'll take two examples from your learnings one is Kotak Mahindra back one is Aavas and one is Vedanta now investment entry point of view is something which I have
