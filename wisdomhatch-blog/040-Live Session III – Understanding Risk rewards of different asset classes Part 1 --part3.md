==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker shares their investment strategy, emphasizing diversification across asset classes, geographies, and currencies to mitigate risks and maximize returns. They highlight personal investments in real estate (South Goa, Dubai, Bangkok), stocks, Bitcoin, and unlisted stocks, aiming for growth, cash flow, and wealth protection. The speaker advocates for a balanced portfolio tailored to individual needs, using Dubai real estate as an example of high-yield cash flow and currency appreciation benefits. They stress the importance of understanding one's financial goals and risks, rather than blindly following any single investment approach.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Diversification is critical**: Spread investments across asset classes (real estate, stocks, crypto), geographies (India, Dubai, Bangkok), and currencies to reduce risk.  
- **Real estate as a strong asset**: Examples include high returns in South Goa, cash flow from Dubai properties (7.25% net yield), and personal-use assets in Bangkok.  
- **Currency and geographic hedging**: Investing internationally (e.g., Dubai) protects against local economic risks (tax changes, currency devaluation).  
- **Growth vs. cash flow vs. wealth protection**: Allocate portfolio based on life stage (e.g., 60% growth assets like equities/crypto for younger investors).  
- **Data-driven decisions**: Use tools like Dubai's blockchain-based property records (e.g., Bayut) to validate investments.  
- **No one-size-fits-all strategy**: Investors must assess their own goals, risk tolerance, and market opportunities to build a personalized portfolio.  
- **Leverage low-cost debt**: Example: Dubai property loans at 5.5% vs. 7.25% rental yield, creating positive cash flow.  
- **Bitcoin’s outperformance**: Highlighted as a high-growth asset (1,500% returns over 5 years) but advised in moderation (~10% portfolio).  
- **Transparency and proof**: Speaker shares specific transaction details to reinforce credibility of their strategy.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
s going to do well in the future in India everywhere so I started buying real estate in South Goa yeah it went up very happy with my investment I recently made another investment in South Goa then I bought one apartment in Dubai okay I learned more about Dubai real estate market okay then I bought one real estate in Bangkok okay this is for my own use right so this is not really an investment investment so what I started doing was that I started thinking that okay real estate is great asset class for me but if I have to diversify more what kind of additional diversification I can add well I can add geographical diversification right so geographical diversification gives me a lot of benefits for example when I bought my Dubai first property last year dirhams was at 23.0 something now it is at 24 so 5% without doing anything my property has gone up why because of the room appreciation because I bought that entire money from India converted that into dirhams right and bought that property there because I did not have any credit history in UA last year but there is a reason because I have started making little bit of money there so now I have credit history so it gives me like diversification benefits now see I can't tell you that you know what type of an investor you should be okay but what I can help you understand is that there are pros and cons to everything okay so which brings us to a very quick input on the concept of concentration versus diversification and why I am a proponent of diversification okay concentration means that hey 5 stocks in entire portfolio and you are done okay diversification means I don't know what will happen in the world right I am very pessimistic okay so what I will do is that I will diversify as much as possible and solve that grid problem for me okay so and I will try to have three types of diversification number one I am going to have asset class diversification which means that I am going to invest in stocks also Bitcoin also high quality assets real estate also high quality real estate okay so as long as I am getting like a good asset for example a land is a high quality real estate and if I am getting that land at good price I will buy it okay similarly if I find HDFC which is a high quality asset at a good price I will buy it so my objective as an investor is this okay so I solve for first equation which is asset class diversification every one understands second call second point it is called as geographical diversification so for example I and I are falling if let's say if my job is also in India and if I own all the properties in India all my stocks on an India then what's the risk that I'm holding I'm holding a geography risk okay so I hope you guys are able to hear me there was a little bit of lag yeah so that's a geography risk right now for some reason right you know there is like you know some tax issue right key Indian government comes and say is that you want 30% tax on every capital gains all types that's a geography risk okay now third risk is called as currency risk okay so currency risk is that if all your assets are India denominated then everything is dependent on India currency okay now we might now it might happen that you know some some issue happens within currency or Asian crisis happens or whatever then there is this risk also so for me diversifying across all these three segments is critical so I hope I'm able to explain your point and what is the perspective with which I diversify so I diversify with this perspective right that I had shown you this grid okay this grid that I need to get a head of the end green check every there so for example cash flow I have a very strong cash flow from my Dubai property okay I have a very strong growth on my India property okay if I look at Bitcoin this gives me growth benefits for example if I show you chart of Bitcoin BTC okay price okay so what you will see right on five year basis Bitcoin has given 1500% returns it has gone 15 times okay last one year 35 it has beaten stock market you look at any three year phase Bitcoin has outperformed every single asset class that is out there on earth so for me it kind of makes sense to have what like little bit of portfolio here okay so why because it solves growth problem okay so I'll have like 10% of my portfolio here okay unlisted stocks now again that solves this growth portfolio okay so they are likely to grow faster than small caps at least the good ones okay so that is their gold if I am wealth protection if if this is the need then I'll buy gold do I buy too much gold no because I don't need wealth protection because if I'm already diversifying for all these three different types of things then automatically my wealth will be protected are you getting okay so honestly this is a conversation you have to draw it up on a spreadsheet figure out what style of investing works better for you and at the end of the day you need to have like an assessment of your network with a pie chart in mind okay so I'll tell you I'm see I'm a hundred CR plus I okay so I've built this wealth on my own okay so let's assume you have kept KITNIA 100 see as I that's useless okay so like my so this is my network if I aggregate all my properties all my stock investing all my international investing etc etc it will be this much okay now what do I need to do right I need to now make a call that how much money do I need to put for growth how much money I need to put for cash flows and how much money do I need to put for wealth protection everyone let me okay so growth I put now because I'm on the younger side I put like 60% for growth so this will be equities this will be US equities Indian equities right US equities this will be cryptos right this will be unlisted stocks this will be my angel investments in some companies okay all that stuff okay now cash flow for example Dubai real estate is a very good if you buy strategic good Dubai real estate it's very good for what cash flows now just to give you an example so I bought a property at 1.4 million dirhams okay in fact I will see because Dubai with the data is also going to be right so it's not as if I can you know sort of rule anyone right so I'll just quickly show it to you for example here is a website to you just go on bail okay and I bought a property here okay so I'll just show you okay my internet is a little bit slow so this called as just a second just a second just give me a second I'll just ask my like maybe my kid is like using what you do or something that's on it okay okay okay yeah all right so hopefully it should be up in a minute okay so all right so I'll just weekly showing right so any as I think the website is not loading for some reason I'll come back to it okay so somebody is on loading I'll activate it whenever it the website is up I think it's generally slow today okay so anyways the point being and I'll just explain it to you verbally and then time permits I'll show you like they're also so basically I bought like a property at 1.4 million dirhams right and now it rents for 120k right and after maintenance everything I make a net yield of 7.25% okay so which is fabulous because this property is free for me why because if I were to borrow against this property I'll get a home loan at 5.5% so without spending much money I get to like a sort of pocket like whatever one and a half percent gains every year okay so which is fabulous right so this is a net cash flow property for me okay so this solves my cash flow equation now honestly like you as an investor you need to have like a very good sense what problem you're solving and have that conversation with you that what specific assets are going to solve so chapter like these I'll just show you right so okay so this is where I had purchased right so this was a two-bedroom property that I had bought okay and in fact if you now properties are going for 1.9 also here and I'll show you that transaction right so I had bought it in November so you you see this 1.4 this was mine okay so fourth November I had bought it with three of my investors okay so you will see in fact you can see all the data right so if you go and check you will see three transactions around this price so these were done by me and two of my investors and you will see and I had rented it right so you'll see that some are going for like 1.13 150 so I was able to rent it three were purchased by us okay on all around like this time right fourth November okay and if you take a look at the rent that we are getting so 130 baby child I coach 1.13 1.5 I had rented it out it is this look okay so anyways if you find it you'll see like you know I was able to rent it at 120 okay so I was just showing you the proof so the big government actually puts all the data on the blockchains so you can actually check everything that okay so this is the website you can go and hunt for properties and this is a very good website to learn about UAE real estate investing as well okay there is still connection problem okay so okay just give me a second I hope it should be okay now but I'll just double check if like you know my family members have you know so you stop all the internet services okay so all right I hope that this is okay now and when my internet seems to be okay now like in case something happens yeah it should be okay now yeah all right yeah it's showing full words should be okay okay all right so okay the website name was Bayuth BAYUT right so it's you can go and check all the transaction data the big government puts everything on a block chain right and that's that okay so anyways the point is that you need to figure out now this is not a push that you go and buy something in Dubai you not buy something in Dubai the idea is always to do what the idea is to do this right that you get green signals somewhere right from this entire grid and overall you have like some greens throughout okay so that's the idea okay so for me t
