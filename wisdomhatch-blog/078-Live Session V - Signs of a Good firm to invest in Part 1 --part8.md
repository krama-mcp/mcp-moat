SUMMARY:
The text discusses how wealthy Indians are leveraging tax benefits by moving money to tax-friendly jurisdictions like the UAE, where they pay zero taxes, and then reinvesting a portion of their savings back into India. The speaker shares a personal example of moving funds from HDFC Bank in India to the UAE to avoid high taxes, highlighting how NRE (Non-Resident External) deposits offer higher returns tax-free. The speaker argues that this trend benefits India by attracting foreign currency (USD) and suggests there's an unspoken encouragement from the Indian government for such practices. The latter part of the text shifts to analyzing a growing business, emphasizing that the primary focus for investors should be on growth rather than short-term profitability or efficiency metrics like ROCE.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Tax Optimization**: Wealthy Indians are saving taxes by moving money to tax-free jurisdictions like the UAE and repatriating a portion back to India, contributing to India's high remittance inflows.  
- **NRE Deposits**: NRE accounts in Indian banks offer attractive, tax-free returns in USD, incentivizing Indians abroad to bring foreign currency back to India.  
- **Government's Implicit Role**: The Indian government appears to tacitly support this system to attract USD inflows, which are crucial for the economy.  
- **Growth Over Profitability**: For certain evolving businesses, growth (e.g., revenue doubling) is the critical metric for investment, not short-term profitability or efficiency (like ROCE).  
- **Home Bias**: Indians abroad tend to retain some wealth in India due to emotional or practical ties, further supporting the economy.  
- **Controversial Insight**: The speaker implies that openly discussing these tax strategies could invite backlash, indicating sensitivity around the topic.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
oney in UAE, pay zero taxes anywhere. Half of that money, whatever they are saving in taxes, they bring it back to India. So there is a reason why remittance wise, India is number one nation in the world and it will continue to happen. Because you're just making rich people leave and saying boss see, we cannot provide you infrastructure. Like, understand the hidden message. Go abroad. Right. Make money. Okay. Save taxes. Just bring it back to India. Okay. So that's the point. Okay. So, and they're happy doing it. Okay. How do I know they're happy doing it? I was a customer of HDFC bank. HDFC bank used to pay me like seven percent on every days. Okay. Then government used to charge me like a third of taxes on that. So net, I used to make 4.9%. Now HDFC now I said that HDFC screw you right. I'm taking money to UAE, right. And they said that, okay, fine. Please give us like NRE deposit. So yes, NRE deposit means that you convert your when you become an LRI, you can convert you have to convert your account into NRO and NRE. And if you bring money back. So HDFC bank's offer. Okay. So we'll give you 5.5% not a NINR in USD. So it just for 4% fall. So that's 9.5%. Indian government comes and says that was cool. Don't pay any tax. Okay. Just bring money in USD terms back to India and take like 9.5% return on zero tax. So I'm not throwing you random numbers to facts. I call these things. Okay. So the point is that the moment I speak about this on public forums, I'll be screwed. Okay. So like so I'm telling you because you guys are my students, right. But I'm telling you, I mean, there is a hidden message. Okay. So any else that was an interesting conversation. And this is true. This is not if Indians abroad are getting rich, India will also get rich. Okay. So that's not a bad sign for India, right. It's it because there is something called as home biasness, right. So if we are investing because we are from India. So some part of our net worth will always remain in India. Right. I have to pay zero tax. No LTCG nothing on it right on on your US dollar based investing. Why? Because Gargimur Githalvarabha whatever you call it, right. Because I then have an option, right. For example, if I'm keeping let's say 100,000 US dollars in Dubai. Okay. Now I have an option to keep it in Dubai or I have an option to, you know, take it to Singapore, right. I have to pay zero tax there. So Indian government says that okay. And what for this way? So no one is going to bring that US dollar back to India in the remittance form. We desperately need US dollars. So NRA is a special scheme. Okay. So this is what what is the game. Okay. If you invest in equity market, that's a separate thing. Okay. So let's take like a quick break. So people are asking for a quick break. Let me just quickly complete this part and then I will do so. This is a P valoration something. Right. Here we are again not looking at R O C E much, right. Because this is an evolving business, right. One, here we are betting on growth rate. Okay. We are betting here. The bet is growth rate. This R O C E debate only comes in fairly mature businesses where you do not see vertical horizontal extensions. Okay. Are these tomato is becoming more efficient right. I don't keep profit. Tability has also not been sorted yet. Okay. So see they are getting net profitable. They are on a positive curve, right. And EPS is growing net profits are growing etc. Revenues have been doubling, right. For example, from 2021, how much have the revenues gone up by in three years, they have increased their revenue six times. So here we are betting on growth of the company or growth of the business. Number one, criticality is growth on this business. Nothing else matters. Okay. If you're holding some at all, you're holding it for growth, not for anything else. Everyone gets it. Okay. It will become consistent, become bound there at some stage. But right now, this is a pure growth play. Okay. Okay. So let's take like a five minute break and come back. Okay. So it's my time. It's 1118 a.m. So 1123. Okay. We'll come.
