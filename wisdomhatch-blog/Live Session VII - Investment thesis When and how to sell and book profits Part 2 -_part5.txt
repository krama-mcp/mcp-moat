SUMMARY:
The speaker discusses their investment strategy, emphasizing a systematic approach (e.g., "50 on 50") and the importance of being "broadly right" in stock market investing rather than seeking perfection. They highlight tax advantages in US stock investing, where short-term trading incurs zero tax for them, giving them an edge. The speaker also stresses the risks of sitting on cash in an inflationary environment (e.g., India’s low risk-free returns post-tax) and the need to fully ride bullish trends. Technical analysis (e.g., support/resistance lines, channel trading) is briefly covered as a tool for entry/exit timing, but the speaker cautions against overcomplicating it, especially for investors (not traders), due to tax inefficiencies in short-term trading.

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Systematic Investing**: The speaker follows a disciplined system (e.g., "50 on 50") and prioritizes being "broadly right" over precise predictions.  
- **Tax Arbitrage**: US stock investing offers them a 100% tax benefit, enabling aggressive short-term trading with zero tax liability.  
- **Inflation Risk in India**: Holding cash post-profit in India erodes value due to low post-tax returns (4.5%) below inflation (6%), leading to poor decision-making.  
- **Technical Analysis for Investors**: Support/resistance lines and channel trading help identify entry/exit points, but complex indicators are discouraged for long-term investors due to tax inefficiencies.  
- **Trend Riding**: The biggest loss is selling too early and missing out on bullish trends; patience and system adherence are critical.  
- **Avoid Overcomplication**: Too many technical indicators can confuse; focus on a few reliable tools for investor-level decisions.  
- **Experience Matters**: Effective system application requires practice (e.g., 20–30 trades) to build intuition.  
- **Trader vs. Investor Mindset**: Technicals should aid entry/exit timing for investors, not shift focus to short-term trading (especially in high-tax regimes like India).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
m. My system is 50 on 50. I follow that. If you want to follow 200, follow 200. Okay. So like, I follow 200 on consistent things. Right. I don't follow, uh, you know, 200 on, uh, other things, right? But again, you can add that to the mix and do whatever computation. The idea is to be broadly right. Right. Stock market investing is a broadly right investing. For example, there is no header leg to buying a land. Okay. You do it because broadly, it looks like a good deal. Okay. There is no header leg to like, you know, sort of again, as I said that, you know, uh, either you explore a pure arbitrage. Okay. For example, for me, US stock investing is a pure arbitrage. Why? Because there is 100% tax benefit for me. Okay. So already I am ahead of like, you know, 99% investors because I'm getting that advantage. Okay. And that's huge for me. Okay. So I can actually play this game more aggressively because for me, short term trading, uh, taxes zero. Okay. So anyone who talks to me, I don't, you know, I'll know the way I do it. Right. So this is the reason why. Right. And if you're serious about markets and if you have like, I don't know, 100 crore, 200 crores of trading capital, Madhi, Madhi, right. So I mean, for example, for example, for example, I don't know, it's like a four-hour trading area, for a few months, Ferrari, really, right. So that's not that too complicated. Okay. So I don't have a Ferrari. My friends have a Ferrari. I just tag along like, I mean, because in Dubai, I'm not, I'm not hooked. Talked to you. I'm a big car. So I don't drive. I don't drive. You're at risk. Right. So I don't drive. I don't drive. I don't drive. You're at risk. Right. So like, I don't do all that. Okay. I only take taxis. I am very happy taking taxis. Okay. So I'm an accident accident. I do a taxi. I don't think it's a two-seater taxi. I do a taxi. Right. So that's a two-jelly. Right. So it's a risk-learning. Right. So that's a simple point. Okay. So that's arbitrage. But when you're going to consistent compounding or consistent things, it's about system. Okay. So my system is 50 on 50. Okay. If you want to have all over the different system, well, and good. No problem. For me, I work with the assumption that the US market and the India market are bullish. At least for now, they are bullish. I don't know when that will change. Like become like Japan market and all that. That's different. Right. But at least as of now, they are bullish. So I work with the assumption and the biggest loss for me would be when I'm unable to ride that rate. Okay. Or exhaust that trend fully and when I sell to early, yeah, that's a problem for me. And I'm just sitting on cash and doing nothing. Now, this is especially true if you're in India or Indian tax resident because your risk-free rate of capital is horrid. Okay. Why? Because let's say that you have one crore. You invested that one crore. It goes to 1.5 crores. Long term. You booked that because that trend reversal is happening. Now you're sitting on, let's say, 60, 70 lakh profit in bank account. Okay. Now you're done. Every with it. Now you are making 4.5% post tax on it. Inflation is 6%. So every year, you're losing 1%. So that makes you impatient. And that's the worst thing that can happen. And then you're desperate to invest. And then you will unnecessarily buy at whatever prices. So I hope this is clear. When to sell, we will continue. Yeah. Just one last comment. Yesterday, you know, I asked a question and you'd said that, you know, I cannot tell you whether it's an executive or portfolio and I will start afresh. But I think some of the points you covered today really answered that. So it's going to be, I think, a free task, but it's for me to do. And I kind of understood, I will have to really break it down and look at each investment. So thanks for that. I think it clarified. Keep informing me guys. I mean, whatever you guys are doing. Right. So I'll go ahead. I have questions. Now, I'll tell you. Right. And then you become like my, what do you call human learning models? Okay. So I would not waste my time like, you know, tracking all this right. I mean, not at like scale every day basis. So I'll go ahead and tell you. Then I'll also adjust accordingly. Right for the US market. Okay. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. Actually, don't the same chart on the Nifty 50 chart. If you can just put that up. You have drawn certain horizontal lines. And I remember even one of your notes, you have said that you have sold Nifty 50 recently in the, because it has made that support line and you move that money into private banking. So can you tell us what is these horizontal? So this is more or less support lines. Right. So for example, there can be a channel support. Or there can be this type of support. So for example, there you can see the consolidation and happened in the past. Yeah. Just a minute. So for example, this right for example, if you zoom this, right, so there are multiple touch points here. Okay. So therefore, this is a support line. Right. This again is a massive support. Okay. This again is a support line. This is a weak support. But these are like all supports, which I've drawn like these orange lines. If Nifty falls like this, this becomes like my buying point from a support line concept. Now channel trading concept case, I'll say this is my support. Now both of these can coincide as well. Right. So for example, this buying point here is coinciding with this orange line. Right. So this is a very strong support. Okay. This is a resistance. Okay. So here I will not buy as of now. Okay. Unless there is a confirmation not like some other type of things. When you recently saw what was allergic, wasn't because of the touch the channel upper point of the channel. What did I transition? You said you sold it. If you can move it to private it. Yes. So because I was trading the channel. And again, if I drop in a downtrend, for example, this. So I sold here. Right. That's what I remember. Exactly. So I sold here. Because the channel exit. Exactly. This was. So I went like almost 8515 ratio. Till that time, this downtrend continues. I will just simply trade this because the chances are that I will. It will fall to here. Okay. So this is what I am anticipating. Right. That might happen. If not, it will go like sideways. Then again, this is a chance. If a break. If a what you call break out happens, then it will go up like this. Okay. Then the trend reversal will happen. Right. This blue green line. Blue black line will become something like this. I'll just mark it. So this blue line will become like this. Black line will become like this. Okay. So then this is a trend reversal. Then we just build much newer positions here at this point. So there is no upside. I mean, because most likely the trend reversal will happen at some. Around here, right. That's what my short term expectation is. Okay. So this is what I'm anticipating. Therefore, I sold like some bit and rotated it. This will come with experience. Right. I mean, you cannot apply the system like. Like without experience. So you will have to take like maybe 20, 30 trades and this will become a little bit more intuitive. Right. But I hope you got my point. Okay. Yes. Paul, I've already shared like an entire video on this. How to draw the end lines. Right. So please, it's that. Okay. Good. Awesome. Just Paul. Yes. Sorry. I was not able to find the raising hand all this while. So I just learned how to do it. Thank you for the opportunity. And just wanted to know because you just covered the trend line SMA. Okay. Simple moving average. So is there anything on the regression models as well like smoothening model or maybe forecast analysis because there is I believe Arama and Sarima as well. So is it. So will you be showing that to see any video on that which we can just because that was also. I'm an investor. I'm not a trader. Okay. The more I learn about technicals, the more trader I will become, which is a useless exercise, especially in a country like India where you're paying 20% STCG. The idea is like the idea of an investor to learn technicals is that you find a great point of entry which I've taught that you ride the entire trend. And number three, you exit partially or fully. Okay. So these three things as an investor is very important. Now there are endless things. I can teach you futures and options also. Right. That's not a problem. But the point is then that's nerdy thing for me. Okay. I like this thick book that I read that I'm reading on like options right now. But the point on US options and investing. But the point is that that's not tax efficient for you. So there is no point in learning all this that you know, Fabinaji retrace paint. Sorry to number then will it help me because see a buying you. I learned a very there is an inside that you have shared. But selling is wherein a lot of people face challenges that were to exit. Okay. So you're giving me the online for the SMA. But can that say if I believe that from this point when the trend is changing. So how would I define maybe that it is going going to go beyond that point. So can't. No, it can't. Right. And the reason is that when it comes to technical indicators, there are powerful technical indicators and then there are weak technical indicators. And they go in priority. Now if I teach you five things, for example, I taught you one thing today. Now if I teach you five things now, two will give you signal X green signal and three will give you or and two will give you red signals. Then you will get confused. Okay. Okay. And then you will give up because that's that's more suited to like technical analysis. We are not doing technical analysis on short term trading basis. This trading view software can be used by high frequency trader that trade on seconds basis. Okay. It can be used on hourly basis, 15 minute basis, five minute basis, one day basis, one week basis, one month basis,
