SUMMARY:
The text discusses investment strategies, focusing on analyzing turnaround stocks like HDFC AMC and PVR. HDFC AMC experienced a 50% price correction despite high revenues and profits due to market downturns affecting its AUM (Assets Under Management). PVR, another turnaround candidate, saw significant stock correction post-merger but shows improving financials. The speaker emphasizes understanding business models, market monopolies, and risk diversification (e.g., limiting exposure to 2.5% of a portfolio for volatile stocks). The text also touches on other stock categories like tech (favoring global monopolies like ASML over Indian tech), value investing (Muinish Pabri’s approach), and "leap of faith" stocks (e.g., Jio, where future potential outweighs current analysis).  

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Turnaround Stocks**: Companies like HDFC AMC and PVR can correct sharply due to external factors (e.g., market crashes, mergers) but may rebound if fundamentals remain strong.  
- **Monopoly Advantage**: Businesses with monopolistic traits (e.g., PVR in cinemas, ASML in semiconductors) are more likely to recover and thrive long-term.  
- **Risk Management**: Limit exposure to high-risk turnaround stocks (e.g., 2.5% of portfolio) vs. stable stocks like HUL (5%).  
- **Tech Investments**: Global tech monopolies (e.g., ASML, Broadcom) are preferred over Indian tech, which lacks innovation.  
- **Leap of Faith Stocks**: Some investments (e.g., Jio) require conviction beyond traditional analysis, betting on future potential despite unclear current business models.  
- **Diversification Strategy**: Categorize stocks (value, cyclical, growth) and invest only in what you understand. Avoid complex strategies like deep-value investing if they’re outside your expertise.  
- **Market Realities**: External factors (e.g., regulations, consumer behavior) can disrupt even solid businesses, but revenue trends (e.g., PVR’s ticket/popcorn sales) signal underlying strength.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
e you need to understand the reason for fall. Okay. Classic case study would be something like let's say HDFC AMC. Okay. So for example if you go and study HDFC AMC and take a look at the price. Okay. So what you will notice is that see between like here to here. Okay. The stock fell quite a lot. Right. In fact the peak was here. Right. 3500 and here in the bottom was 1700. So there was a 50% correction from here to here. Okay. In fact even if you look at it because this is like 2019. But if you look at it from here. So this was again 3300 to this. So this was a complete downtrend. Okay. And this corrected to 1500. Okay. So 50% fall and happen in this zone from 2021 and to 2022. Now what does HDFC AMC does? AUM business. Okay. You know HDFC AMC takes that right. It builds a bucket right and it charges a commission 2% of whatever. Okay. And this becomes its revenues. Okay. So like what happened between 2021 and 2022. The markets fell. Okay. So as a result people stopped doing SIPs right and even the holdings of HDFC AMC they would have shrunk inside. They would have become like this. Why? Because the market itself corrected. So for example what is this AUM made up of? It is made up of IDZ stock. Whatever like you know HUL etc etc stocks that they have. So this total assets under their management. The price of this also corrected. No. That's what market correction means. Okay. What was happening to its revenues profit in this zone 2021, 2022. So you'll see that okay. Just look at 2021, 2022. Okay. Nothing else. Profits were revenues were all time high. Okay. Profits were all time high. Yet the stock went through a 50% price correction. Okay. And this was a great turnaround stock. It meets all our 17, 18 criteria that it's a low operating profit margin business. Very high time deals with premiumization. Good turnaround story. Good brand, clean brand, opportunities for vertical horizontal integration. They can launch a new fund anytime. All that stuff. And we bought it and it went through a turnaround. So there are good quality companies which we are which will go through a turnaround. Right. What about PVR right now? Okay. So for example if we go and study PVR. Okay. Now let's look at revenues profits. Okay. Okay. All time high revenues. 6127. 6107. What about profits? So profits are improving. Right. Now it's okay. Why did it become like 750 crore in net losses in 2021 because PVR and IONOX merged. Okay. Now when merger happens there are a lot of dead weight. But dhiri dhiri karke it's getting into a turnaround zone. Every on that me. Okay. Now dhiri dhiri karke upar bada jai ka right. I mean I don't know like I mean so ETS is improving all that stuff. Now whenever it happens right. I don't know when it will happen. Right. And how much has the stock corrected by? So from it speak. It is corrected by almost 60%. Right. Now is this like a good stock bad stock you make a call right whether it is good stock or bad stock I will not say. But to cut the long story short this is a turn around stock. This you cannot judge it to be similar to Asian pains or HUL or Nestle. Okay. Nestle HUL. Agarabagira you buy it. The only mistake that you will make on those stocks is that you are not buying any type of price correction time correction 200 DM. On these type of stocks the mistake that you will make is number one you're over invested. If HUL we are investing 5% HDFC AMC HDFC life we are investing 5% of our portfolio. What is the maximum we should invest in PVR? 2.5. That's it. Okay. Now dhiri dhiri karke upar bada jai ka portfolio with a bada jai right. Now even if you bought it like one two years back let it. Ho rao ka forti wasan noxan jillodola right. So it's not that big a deal right. After two three years four years it's still if it still remains a monopoly business it will be fine. So what about like PVR right. Do you think that it's a monopoly business or what like or do you think that it will survive in the next three five years? Why not. Anyone thinks that it will not survive. I'm happy to get I'm happy to get like their viewpoint. Nope. Okay. Netflix it will survive. Yeah. Karnataka government has restricted ticket price. Will this I don't know like I mean they will now by that logic like I mean a government will say that okay we are going to open like theaters for people like as freebies or whatever. So we're not investing any business then right. So let's leave that aside right. Hopefully free markets will survive because by that logic we go to socialist or a communist regime right where all modes of production is controlled by the government right. So if that happens then stock market is done we can't do anything. People are still not going to movies then how is PVR generating like six thousand gross of revenues right. So that's like an interesting problem to solve then right. So numbers tell a difference. So we might believe that people are not going right. Now they'll say that no people will not buy like 500 to P. P. See people are buying what can I do right. I mean if people are buying their buying there's nothing that I can do about that right. So they are selling they are making that kind of revenues right. So beat through popcorn beat through like Pepsi or beat through movie tickets or whatever it is they are generating revenues right. I mean if people were not going to the movies how would they sell popcorns and make revenues right. They are doing something which is allowing them to make more revenues and if the business stays monopoly then of course it will come back up to its previous price okay. So that's the bottom line these are called as turn around stocks okay. So I'll just quickly cover this right. Consistent amount is I'm not ready to turn around I'm not ready to cyclical we have seen right and tech stocks growth stocks. Now here the trick is that you figure out which specific segment intake will grow right because not entire tech might grow. Now if you do not know how to study this right it's okay that you can just simply go and buy NASDAQ right and it's okay you can go and simply buy M7 businesses. There is a business called ASML right. So I mean which is a monopoly business which provides like prefabs to semiconductor companies in China, US etc. That's a monopoly business there is no other business similar to ASML right. Broadcom is again a monopoly business right. All these are good solid companies that you could consider but you need to understand that tech behind it right. And if you don't have the time patients or inclination to study like tech companies then leave it. India tech is not tech just leave it right. I mean completely like I'm in my advice would be to get out of Indian tech that is nowhere close right to innovation right. I mean we if you still want to better just simply bet it on like Nifty IT index right and that itself might give growth but individual tech companies in India they are very hard to understand okay. Yeah just leave it okay value stocks. So this is like Muinish Pabri type of stocks. So Muinish Pabri is a legendary investor what he does is that he buys companies which are very very cheap. He'll buy it at 3 4 p 5 p and then wait for 10 years 15 years 20 years for P you to go to like 20 okay and then suddenly there is some kind of a manual sale okay. But his starting point is that he will buy really cheap companies. He'll not ever touch firms like Google Amazon. Can you make money doing that type of investing? Maybe I don't know how to do it so I can't teach you that okay. It's really difficult to complicate it right. So I would stay away right. I would play the game that I understand right. So for me capital rotation etc on good companies businesses that I keep hearing about etc is okay. I mean that's a game that I can play right. So you pick whichever game you want to play right. So that's the idea there okay. Okay so these are value stocks cyclical stocks you have figured out turnaround consistent compounder. 2x5x stocks are something that I will speak tomorrow when I talk a little bit about unlisted stocks so I will cover it there okay. So I'll not touch it as of now okay. Leap of faith stocks now what a leap of faith stocks now. Leap of faith stocks are very simple right so leap of faith simply means Google okay. So for example right now its business is getting disrupted. And no amount of analysis no amount of reading on publicity about Google's business model will convince you that it's going to survive or not survive okay. It will not tell you right. 5 analysts will say that okay Google will survive 5 analysts will say that no it will not survive. You have to make a call whether or not you need to take a leap of faith with Google or not okay. So geo is exactly a leap of faith stock right. Some people will say it has no business model it has not this it has not by you know jungle color yeah right I mean one taro whatever right and got like Modi G2 become a model there right. So do you not think that they will be able to build like a you know finance business right. So of course they are going to build it right. Regulation is the number one barrier right when it comes to like finance stocks or banks or regulations whatever. So they are going to do like exceptionally well when it comes to like geo right. So you have to have that leap of faith on these type of stocks is there a way to analyze it no okay. I myself said when I bought geo there is no business model yet okay but geo understands geo finance understands that finance gives great money they will go into everything right from mutual fund maybe like payments bank maybe like wealth management etc. And you just have to understand how India works and billionaire businesses will survive and thrive right. So just leave it at that. So there will be category of stocks. Important point for you to understand is that whatever stocks for example audit your portfolio whatever stocks you have right you should be able
