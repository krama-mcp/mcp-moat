SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses two main concepts in business analysis: distinguishing between **industry-wide problems** and **company-specific problems**, and understanding **cost of capital (WACC)** and **return on invested capital (ROIC)**. It explains that industry-wide issues (e.g., rising oil prices) affect all players, while company-specific problems (e.g., brand scams) impact individual firms. The discussion then shifts to capital structure, comparing equity and debt financing, and emphasizes that a company's **ROIC should exceed its WACC** to be sustainable. Examples include a critique of Adani Enterprises (where WACC > ROIC) and contrasts with strong performers like HUL and Asian Paints (high ROIC). The analysis excludes financial stocks (e.g., banks) due to their unique business models.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
1. **Industry vs. Company Problems:**  
   - *Industry-wide*: Systemic issues (e.g., commodity price hikes) affect all competitors.  
   - *Company-specific*: Unique challenges (e.g., brand scandals) require individual scrutiny.  

2. **Cost of Capital (WACC):**  
   - Blend of debt (interest payments) and equity (dividends/ownership dilution) costs.  
   - **WACC must be lower than ROIC** for sustainable profitability (e.g., Adani’s 14.96% WACC vs. 9.87% ROIC is unsustainable).  

3. **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC):**  
   - Measures efficiency in generating profits from capital.  
   - **Mature companies** should target ROIC >15% (e.g., HUL at 27.2%, Asian Paints at 37%).  

4. **Exceptions for Financial Stocks:**  
   - Banks/financial firms operate differently (e.g., borrowing from deposits at near-zero rates) and are excluded from WACC/ROIC analysis.  

5. **Investor Lens:**  
   - Fundamental investors avoid companies with ROIC < WACC (signaling poor capital allocation).  
   - Temporary ROIC dips may be acceptable if future growth is anticipated.  

6. **Practical Analysis:**  
   - Quick checks (e.g., ROIC/WACC ratios) can filter stocks, but deeper tools (e.g., Porter’s Five Forces) may be needed for nuanced decisions.  

7. **Examples Highlighted:**  
   - **Adani Enterprises**: High WACC and political reliance make it risky for fundamental investors.  
   - **HUL/Asian Paints**: High ROIC demonstrates competitive advantage and operational efficiency.

**Note:** The text blends conceptual explanations with real-world examples, emphasizing investor-centric analysis while acknowledging complexities (e.g., equity/debt trade-offs).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
a company specific problem or is this an industry specific problem? Now, that's a very important aspect of business analysis. Okay. This is called as industry wide problem and company specific problem. Now, industry wide problem means that if the oil barrel goes from 100 to $100 to $150, now, does this only impact Asian paints or does it impact the entire industry? It impacts everyone. So this is not a problem for Asian paints. Shifting customer dynamics. This again is very vague. Okay. I was not going to train them a little bit. You know what? Okay. Some study has been done and Asian paints. People are not preferring or there is some kind of brand scam that is happening or Asian paints is like, you know, doing like some shady stuff and all that. Then it's a problem. Okay. So I hope that this point is clear that how do you analyze basic mode and you have for chat, GPT, up or complexity, up and you have to look at it. Right. So you can just simply go and run this analysis fairly quickly. Okay. So I hope that this this point is clear and chat GPT, what do you call publicities fairly accurate on this? Okay. So honestly, these are generally they have covered like almost 80, 85% of the points really. Okay. So it's not as if that you need to apply a lot of brain and this can be done fairly quickly. Everyone with me. Okay. But if you want to do a deeper analysis, you can go to portus by forces and think about every element. Okay. Everyone gets it. Okay. All right. So I hope that this point is clear. Industry expanding can survive. Key success factors. Next point is cost of capital and is the debt sensible? Now this is a slightly technical point. So I'll try to explain it to the best of my ability. Right. So what happens is that when you start a company, for example, if I start wisdom hatch, I have two options of getting capital. Capital means that I get money. Okay. One is called as equity capital. In one is called as a debt capital. Now debt I can get easily because if I go to a loan and say that here I'm starting wisdom hatch, can you please give me one crore loan? The bank will say, okay, fine, take one crore loan and give me all this fees and start paying me 10% interest. Okay. So this is called as debt capital. Equity capital means that I don't go to a bank. I go to investor. So let's say that I go to Anilji, right? And I say that he or which guy please give me like, you know, 10 lakhs. Right. I want to build a website and hire like three developers, all that stuff. And in return, I'll give you like 10% of my company. So you become you own 10% of the company, I own 90%. This is called as equity financing. And this is called as debt financing. If you add equity plus debt, this is cost, this is called as and you take an average. This is called as cost of capital. More specifically, it is called as a back WACC weighted average cost of capital because I might raise 10% debt, 90% equity or 30% debt, 70% equity or whatever. Okay. So this is called as back WACC. Everyone understands what WACC is. Okay. Business school professors take like three classes to teach this. Okay. I don't teach in you like five minutes. Okay. So, okay. Now, fine. Now I got it. I got it. I was able to raise money. Okay. Now what do I do with this money? Well, let's say that I was able to raise one crore. Now I put this one crore in my business. I build a website. I advertise whatever. And by next year, I make like two crores. Then I make I procs. Then I make 10% okay. And my profit of it is which is great. Right. My business starts expanding. Now, when will but add the same time, right. I have to keep paying my debt because bank is not going to wait. Right. Bank will command their 10% every year. Or my investors will expect me to deliver them. Sorry, my investors will expect me to deliver or give them some dividends. Okay. So this is called as so what do I need to do? So I raised money. Right. I have something called as WACC. Okay. I need to pay dividends. I need to pay debt or repayment of debt or EMI. Plus I need to generate profits. Okay. Now if I add all these things, right. So for example, let's say my WACC is 100 units. Okay. But half all this, right. Let's say that my profits are let's say 150. Okay. Minus dividends, I pay 30 and debt, I pay 20. Then I'm at 100 units, right. Off on the right hand side. Okay. And 100 units here. Right. So this is a profitable trade for a company that I raised money. I'm able to generate enough profits. And then I'm paying my debt holders and equity holders. Or in simple words, my weighted average cost of capital is not higher than the returns that my company is generating. Okay. I'll say that again, that the weighted average cost of my capital is not higher than the returns that my company is generating. Okay. Now this in simple terms returns that my company is generating on the total capital that I've taken is called as ROIC or return on invested capital or ROI or whatever you call it. Okay. So we'll not get into technical definition. What I want to say our goal is not to become a content. Now someone asked me that, okay, what about like a Danny D business did that stuff? So you check. Okay. So you go and type out. Just a second, guys. Okay. So you go and type out. WACC or weighted average cost of capital for Adani. Okay. So you'll say that WACC is 14.96. So Adani has to pay 14.96 as what you call outflows. Okay. Now if you go to Adani enterprise now which is which will give you a fair representation. And here you'll say ROCE is 9.87. Now what does this indicate? This indicates that they are roughly borrowing at 13, 14% and generating 10% return on that capital. Now is this a sensible business model? The short answer is a no. Okay. Now is it a no for every type of investor? No. Like come and see. Now there are different different types of investors. For example, there are fundamental investors. Now no sensible fundamental investor is ever going to invest one rupee in Adani stocks. Okay. Because there is no competitive advantage that Adani has except for political patronage. Okay. That's it. Okay. You take away six of their ports. They are screwed. Okay. So and that can that be done? Yes. At some stage. Right. If the government changes and all that stuff. Who knows? Okay. Now, yeah. So all those are complicated things. Now a fundamental investor does not bet on these type of events. If you are analyzing stuff fundamentally, industry wise, then the company that you're picking, it's weighted average cost of capital needs to be lower than it's ROIC. Okay. ROC. Okay. So everyone gets this. And this is applicable to non-finan stocks. This the ROIC WACC conversation. We cannot check it for HDFC bank, etc. For example, if you go to let's say HDFC, HDFC bank. So here you will say ROC is 7.67. Now this is a finance stock. So you ignore it. Now why are we ignoring finance stocks? Because here the lending and borrowing rules work differently. For example, where do banks borrow money from? To the borough it from you most of the time. The short answer is no. Their borrowing rates are very different. Right. For example, when you give your money in savings, how much is the bank borrowing your money for? Zero. Okay. So like you're not getting anything right on savings. Okay. Corporate accounts is zero. Okay. If they're borrowing from it from RBI, it's less. Okay. So so that gets into complication. The money itself is forward to them because their business model is not that they will take money invested into something else and create something of value and sort of entire chain. So for finance companies, we ignore this. Right. For rest of the manufacturing companies, this ROIC slash WACC theory is very important. Okay. So I hope that this point is clear. Someone has asked me two questions. I'll just quickly take that. Why will a bank lend you money to start a company? So that was just an example and sometimes banks do lend. Right. So for example, if I'm already an established entrepreneur, if I have cash flows, then they might lend me against my assets. Okay. So I can take a business loan. Right. For example, very similar how people take construction loan on their existing land. So that can also be done. What is the cost of capital you're talking about on equity to calculate? So here we are not doing like I'm explaining your broad concept. Now you will not even be able to assess this. Right. This is very complicated. Yeah. Dhani G pay equity financing. Githni and debt financing. That's corporate finance. We are not getting there. Right. What I'm trying to tell you is that I'm helping you develop a 360 degree view point for an investor. As investors, we are part lawyers, part accountants, part C is, etc, etc. We are not like a lawyer or a PSG. Okay. So that's WACC should not be higher. Yes. Or ROIC should be higher than WACC. Okay. So I hope that this concept is clear. Businesses where this is not happening or is unlikely to happen in the future. Right. That's a problem. Okay. So for a mature company, for example, if you take a look at any mature company, let's say HUL. Okay. Now what is ROIC? ROC 27.2. It's a lot of work. Okay. But like I mean, if you because sometimes this note also keeps on changing. Right. So but anytime a mature company has a ROIC more than 15% that's fairly good. You can consider that to be in your consistent type of stocks. Okay. What about like Asian penetration bands are we come over. Okay. Okay. So ROC is 37. I don't know how 37. Right. But point being that this should be more than 15% right. So that's what we are aiming for. Right. So and this is a check mark. Okay. So basically this is a list. So if it is less than like 14% then definitely it's a no. If it is temporarily, let's say 10% but you feel that AgitlK it will be like 15%, 20% all that stuff. Then it kind of makes sense. Okay. But in an event where the ROC is already like 9% and you don't see this improving too much, then that company s
