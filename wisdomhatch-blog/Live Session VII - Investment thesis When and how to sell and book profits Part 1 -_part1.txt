SUMMARY:
**  
The transcript is from a live session discussing investment strategies, focusing on when and how to sell stocks to book profits. The speaker covers portfolio construction, the importance of balancing macro, fundamental, and technical analysis, and the psychological aspects of investing. Key topics include the pitfalls of mutual funds (e.g., difficulty exiting and tax implications), the need for a disciplined selling strategy, and the risks of passive investing in scenarios like Japan's stagnant market. The session aims to provide practical FAQs and 10 specific points on selling strategies.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Portfolio Diversification:** The speaker emphasizes a flexible approach to portfolio allocation (e.g., 5% caps for large-cap stocks) but stresses that personal preferences and risk appetite should guide decisions.  
- **Holistic Analysis:** Successful investing requires combining macro, fundamental, and technical analysis—no single method suffices.  
- **Investor Psychology:** Emotional discipline is critical; chasing rallies or reacting impulsively to losses can derail long-term success.  
- **Mutual Fund Drawbacks:**  
  - *Exit Challenges:* Investors often fail to exit underperforming funds due to lack of market awareness, risking long-term financial goals.  
  - *Taxation Issues:* Advisors may overlook global tax implications (e.g., rising LTCG taxes in India), impacting returns.  
- **Passive Investing Risks:** Blindly relying on index funds or SIPs can backfire in stagnant markets (e.g., Japan’s 0% returns over decades).  
- **Selling Discipline:** Booking profits is easy, but cutting losses requires rational decision-making to avoid compounding downturns (e.g., SIPs turning into 30% portfolio losses).  
- **Customized Strategies:** There’s no one-size-fits-all approach; investors must align strategies with their goals, knowledge, and risk tolerance.

 Okay, I actually good morning, good morning. Yeah, good morning actually. I should I have missed the Q and A session in the last. Last hour. So I need to ask the question today. Actually, we have talked about the portfolio building, right? Yes. And in that portfolio building, what my assumption is that the you have said the 18 points in how to select the stocks. And also, you know, a lot of videos. Yes, and now all of your videos you have said about the 5 percentage cap for the every stock, right? So if I keep 5 cap 5 percentage cap for around the same, for example, 15 large cap stocks and 5 5 mid cap stocks that cap that 2.5 percentage and 10 small cap stocks, 1.5 percentage. What is the opinion about this? That's a personal poll. I cannot say like I mean, for example, it's like the goal is to eat like 110 grams of protein a day. Now, how you do it? If you have vegetarian, you have your own diet. If you are non-vegetarian, you have your own diet. If you are a seafoodian, then you are, you have your own diet. There are different categories of vegetarian. For example, they will only eat like curry, right? They will eat egg and still be vegetarians, right? They will be like, you know, they will eat like whatever like non-vegetarian, but only eat curry and that's why I cannot comment on it. It really is like depends on how you want to structure that portfolio. I can give you broad rules and accordingly, you need to adjust according to your preferences. Cool. Awesome. So guys, I'll take the question towards the end, right? And we'll start. We'll start. Like in today, everything will come together. Hopefully, right? And let me like do two things, right? So on this session, let me do like two things. One is that I will just deepen this, right? These seven-aid type of stocks, right? I'll tell you a little bit about unlisted investing as well, right? My thesis behind it. And I'll give you a quick intro, right there. And that's one. Second, we will speak about when to sell. So this is the primary agenda. So I will take you through some FAQs that you guys keep on asking me. That okay, when should I say, I'm on 20% profit, 40% loss, this is that stuff. And then I'll share like 10 points as to specifics of selling. Okay, so this is like, hopefully I'll be able to cover on in the next couple of hours. Okay, awesome. So let's start, right? And yesterday we spoke about and just to quickly help you understand where we stand. So three types of analysis. One is called as macro, right? Second is called as business or fundamental analysis. And third is called as technical analysis, where we look at charts and graphs and make calls. All these three things work together. Okay, this is the most important thing that I learned as an investor. It's not as if that you can be a pure macro investor, right? That big, big trend story. And then you don't look at like at whatever price you are buying. It doesn't work that way, right? You have to understand how to analyze businesses because if you purely just work on technicals, for example, 95% of the traders cannot even make FD returns. Okay, so that's mathematically, this is not a sound strategy. Okay, so this is one, right? This is like one part of finance slash investing. The second part of finance and investing has got nothing to do with finance or investing. It has to do with the type of a human you are. You must not have to do that. I will not be surprised. For example, do grab a small loop, jump right. So for example, as long as I'm like buying at sensual price, temporary losses are okay. Right? So if you are not a real investor, you are not a real investor. Right? See, think rationally, right? There are like 6,000, 8,000 listed stocks. You cannot catch rally in everything. Okay, you'll go mad. Otherwise, you'll just keep on running like, you know, morning to evening, try to chase rallies. If a new slash happens in your front, you will get excited about that stock. Someone will say that I bought Bitcoin today. My Bitcoin went up by 200%. Then you will fail for more. So if you are not a sorted person in your brain, you cannot be a good investor. Okay, so that's like the second part is very important. Yesterday I said that you have to pass, pass, pass, pass, enter engineering. Whatever like it, there are like so many things to it. Whatever feels best. Okay. People ask me, do you do it? No. Okay, so I do this. So I tomorrow I'm going jet skiing. Okay, someone will come and go. I do all this type of stuff. Okay, I don't do all this. Okay, so I don't even meditate. Okay, so it's like being clear. Okay, so whatever give you clarity, you do that. Okay, whatever you enjoy. So, okay, so that's that's what I would say, right? And all these four things come together. And accordingly, it makes you as an investor. And you define your risk appetite. That's the most important bit. Now comes that. Okay, fine. Great. Awesome. Right. And now what do I need to do is that fine. You have told me that I can buy like number one. Number one, I can buy like index. Okay. Number two, I can buy mutual funds. Number three, I can buy stocks directly. Now what are the primary advantages disadvantages of this? Of mixing these three strategies, right? For example, can you be a pure index investor and make 12 to 15% returns? If the or more specifically, can you generate an alpha of 3% 4% absolutely? Yes. Okay, if you're 100% just index investor, you can do that. What's the advantage? The advantages that you save massive commissions? For example, I typically do not invest in mutual funds. All my mutual funds are index funds. Okay, for example, nifty 50 is an index. Private bank ETF slash private bank mutual funds are an index. There is not much difference between ETF versus mutual funds. There are small, small differences. But again, we are splitting here if we tried to understand everything, right? People keep on debating. The ETF is not here. I am mutual fund doesn't matter much, right? The idea is again that to eat like 100 grams of protein to retain your muscle mass. That's what we are focusing on. Okay. Now whichever mode you do that, okay? This is important, right? I would rather prefer this over this. Now you'll say that no, my active felonate income mutual fund gives me like this percent alpha, that percent alpha. See guys, I'm not debating that. If you feel confident to that, you can be a 100% mutual fund investor. No problem. The primary problem that I see with mutual fund is exit. Okay. Problem is that most of the mutual fund investors do not exit mutual funds ever. Now that is where the problem lies because if we become like a market like Japan, and I had shown you earlier last week that Japan market was like this that between 1990 to 20, 24, 80 gave how much returns 0%. Okay. So you made 0% returns. Now if you are an SIP doer and mutual fund and if this situation comes, for whatever reason, I'm not saying that this will come, but it could come potentially, right? And if you have no understanding of the fact that okay, you know what boss I'm here, right? And this is not working out for whatever reason, whatever macro changes have happened, then you can't revise your investment thesis because you do not have the knowledge, acumen to do it. Okay. And that is where the problem is that you will get stuck. And what does this do? This does this destroys your long term financial plans. You're getting it why because you started your retirement planning at 30 assuming that you know what I'll get like 12, 13%, 15% run up. But what ends up happening is that after 30 years of investing or whatever, right? You lose, right? Because what I get is if you. Good investors, profit booking is very easy for everyone. Okay. If you're sitting on 20% 30% profit, you can easily book it. But can you book 30% loss? No. Then let me give you practical example. For example, people who started their SIP in the year 2024, almost all those SIPs are down by 10%. Okay. In 2025. Now you're sitting in 2025 and you're saying, you know what? Minus 10%. So I should buy more because if I exit, then I have to book like real loss. So this you will not do. So you'll buy more in 2025. So your portfolio went investment went from this to this. Okay. Now if for some reason, we are on this downward sloping trajectory. Now you're at 15% loss and you keep on having like, you know, losses after losses. And then at one point, it becomes like a nightmarish scenario that you're sitting on 30% loss on your portfolio, not individual stock on your portfolio. And then you don't exit. Okay. So this is the problem primarily that this is the first key problem that I see in mutual fund that selling becomes really complicated. Because number one, the incentives are very wrong that you do not learn anything about selling. You don't follow the stock market. You don't follow any indicators. You don't study macros. You just leave it outsource all your hard work, all your hard and money to a person X. And you let them make calls. Okay. And their defense will be that C was market fell by like 15% I generated like minus 14. So I'm still better. Okay. So you say, I'm about to say, this is the first key problem. Okay. The second key problem, which is a much more realistic problem, I would say. In fact, the first was also important. The second key problem is taxation. Now this is something that knows advisor will tell you right because they themselves haven't migrated abroad and have no understanding of how taxes are structured outside the world. So they will just their entire working space will be India specific. Okay. What is happening is that till 2018 until 2017 the LTCG long term capital gains tax on equities was zero. Okay. Then it was 10% okay. Then it went to 12.5% by 2023.
