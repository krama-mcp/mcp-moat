SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a discussion involving an individual seeking investment advice across various markets (US, India, Dubai, Singapore) and asset classes (stocks, Bitcoin, real estate). Key topics include:  
- Applying technical analysis (support/resistance) to US markets, noting higher volatility in US tech stocks compared to Indian markets.  
- Safe Bitcoin investment strategies (preferring ETFs over direct ownership in India due to tax implications).  
- Comparing real estate yields in Mumbai (low returns, high taxes) vs. Dubai (higher post-tax yields, better legal safeguards).  
- Advice for Indian expats in Singapore to diversify portfolios globally (US stocks, Singapore REITs) while maintaining some exposure to India.  
- Emphasis on diversification across emerging (e.g., India, Mexico) and developed markets (e.g., US, Singapore) for stability.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
1. **US Market Volatility**: US tech stocks are more volatile than Indian markets (e.g., Amazon’s 36% "dip" in 2021), but technical analysis principles (support/resistance) remain applicable.  
2. **Bitcoin Investment**:  
   - In India, opt for Bitcoin ETFs (lower taxes) over direct ownership or platforms like CoinDCX (high taxes).  
   - Hardware wallets are safer for direct Bitcoin holdings.  
3. **Real Estate Strategy**:  
   - Dubai offers better net yields (~8% post-tax) vs. Mumbai (~2% post-tax), plus stronger legal protections (e.g., bounced checks are criminal offenses).  
   - Caution: Dubai’s market is currently peaking; invest selectively. Long-term rentals avoid management fees.  
4. **Global Diversification**:  
   - Indian expats should allocate 50–60% of portfolios to non-Indian assets (e.g., US stocks, Singapore REITs) for currency stability and risk hedging.  
   - Singapore REITs and real estate are attractive (zero capital gains tax), though property is expensive for non-residents.  
5. **Emerging Markets**: Maintain 20–30% exposure to emerging economies (e.g., India, Mexico) alongside developed markets for balanced growth.  
6. **Risk Management**: Prioritize jurisdictions with strong legal systems (e.g., Dubai, Singapore) over volatile or tax-heavy markets.  
7. **Long-Term View**: Diversification across geographies and asset classes (stocks, crypto, real estate) is critical for resilience.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 is the technicals that you taught today. So for example, I have some money tied in RSC. What I'm trying to do is try to try to use RSC using US and trying to like sell it out and invest through West Indian US stockets and not being into India right now. So do the technical analysis that you just taught today is that applicable to US markets also there is some nuance that I should take care of like looking at resistance and support and growth and so on. So how should I think from that perspective? It was right now I am at the verge of investing and I want to understand us. Slightly different in the sense that for example, US tech stocks are slightly more volatile. Right. So for example, Bitcoin is completely volatile. US tech is more is between like Indian is between nifty 50 and like you know Bitcoin you know. So for example, Amazon itself corrected by 36% in 2021 dip. Okay. That was not even a fall it was a dip. Okay. So it is slightly volatile. Basic principles remain the same but you just keep that in mind that okay. You know there is more volatility. So the up and down movement that curve will be bigger. Yeah. Okay. But the final question I know this is a stock market kind of course but what is the safe strategy to invest in Bitcoin? I think you have mentioned it in the past but sorry for the reputation. Yeah. Same stuff. Right. Pick a good entry point. Right now is a good entry point. Okay. Because we are getting into the mechanism. So I'm talking about the mechanism because in India it's not really easy and simple. Okay. All right. So see I mean I would say that by it in ETF format don't buy it in Bitcoin format unless you have a hardware wallet. So one is that you buy pure Bitcoin right. Go to Palika Vazar do it in PL2PR that's the only option. Second option is that you buy it when like in a coin DCX and all that don't do that. Okay. Because it attracts the highest accession. Third option is that you buy it through Wested a Bitcoin West or something. Okay. So because that will have lower taxation for you because it considered as an ETF it's not considered as Bitcoin. Invested. Invested. Yeah. All right. Thank you. All right. Yeah. Sandra. Thanks for all the sessions. So far, I'm sure. A very personal question but I think it might help many of us. Yeah. So I have two residential properties that are fulfilling around 2.5 years and they are just giving me pre expenses and pre-tax like 3.5% or so right now. So as a person who's an Indian tax resident and might continue to be here in the long term as well. Okay. Where do you own these properties? In Mumbai itself. Oh my god. Yeah. So would you advise like can it be a sensible thing for me to consider like investing in Dubai real estate and that might make sense for me considering I'm going to be a Indian resident. Yes. Because the even if you buy like average properties in Dubai, right? I mean at decent price right? I mean assuming that you're buying a good Dubai property, you will easily make 6% net yield. Okay. On that 6% you will pay 30% tax. So up to get the one third up and fake are there. So net yield that you're making is 4.4.5 in the terms. Add 3% 4% add on. So how much is the INR returned? So it's approximately 8% you're making correct? So you're making 8% after tax right even on the buy property. But in India you're getting like in Mumbai, you're getting paid in INR terms 3% on top of that you're paying one third as tax. So you're making net 2% so the difference is 8.5 minus 2. So does it make more sense if the goal is to own a property in a metro in Dubai? Yes. 100% yes. Is infrastructure better in Dubai? 100% yes. Are that 10 and see law safer in Dubai? Yes. Okay. For example, like I'm in the 10 and to my rented out to his check bounced. Okay. And in Dubai, if you're check bounced, it's a criminal offense. The first thing that happens is a travel ban. Okay. So yeah. So be very careful about all these things. If you're wishing to check to someone, have money in your account. It's not like India, he's a bounce over here. If you'll like you're putting in all that stuff. You can go to jail. You can not getting right. So it's it's very stringent laws. So yeah, I mean for me if I were to buy like honestly, I'm not a metro guy. I don't like metro cities. I don't know if it's a dumb nikaal jati or someone asked me to come to Bangalore Mumbai Delhi. So there's so far so so one is a fellow right. Dubai is like one city I like. Right. So I mean because it's fluid. It's easy to travel and all that right. It's needs. Okay. Right. But for me, like I mean, if I have to live in a metro, it would be like Dubai and all right. So it kind of makes sense. But even from an investing point of view, it makes sense now. And that's one important point guys. I mean, because many of you would get very excited to invest in Dubai. But please note that Dubai real estate market is at a peak. Okay. So it could go sideways or there can be correction because people buy Dubai property for trading. Yeah. So there is likely to be a correction. So let me issue that warning also. Okay. So you have to be very, very picky right now in terms of buying properties in the way. Right. So I'm actually the more about the property management expenses in Dubai because No, so see, I mean, if you're doing it on long term basis, then it doesn't matter. I mean, there's no property management expenses. Right. In terms of long term, you're just, for example, I have rented it on long term. Right. So I don't pick up any cost except for paying the Mac, the builder right now, early maintenance. Right. Rest of the maintenance is done by like my tenant only. So what if you're putting it up on Airbnb, then you have to do a revenue share. It's typically between like 15% to 20% they charge. But again, that is a structured system. So it's easy to find people to manage your properties. Right. Okay. Thank you. I think I've already asked. Thank you. Okay. Harsh. Yeah. Thank you so much for all the insights. I'm employed in Singapore and I shifted here only two and a half years back. So most of my portfolio be real estate, be it stock, season in India. And now it's it's I from the last two days, but I hear is that you know, should should we be building up a portfolio here in Singapore. So and how should like what are the asset classes should be in crypto should be like end hours kind of funds or still focus in the Indian market. See, if you're outside India, then you should have at least 56% exposure outside India. Right. I mean, if I lived in Singapore, right. So and if I get a chance to go back to Singapore, maybe I'll do it. I mean, I'm not think right. So I mean, I might set up a company in Singapore or Malaysia. I'm deciding right now like between one of these two places. I like Singapore, right. And my only complaint is the whether it's constantly humid. That's the only thing. That's a boring city. I know it's very small. Right. So that's my complaint. But Singapore is great. Right. If I were in Singapore, when capital gains from is zero, right. Which is brilliant. So I will do US talk investing. I will do dividend investing in Singapore. Right. For example, there are a lot of reads that you can buy in Singapore and reach is basically a transfer and see concept. Right. So in India, I will never buy reads. But if I were to buy reads in Singapore, I'll do it. Right. If I can't buy a house. Okay. And even like the real estate is very good in Singapore. Right. That's what my understanding is. Because if you think about it from a long term structure, 15, 20 year viewpoint, Singapore is making extremely hard for people to come in settlement Singapore. Right. I mean, the minimum ticket size as an HNI is like you need to have like 10 million dollars to even start thinking about shifting to Singapore. Right. So which is huge. Right. So it's going to be high quality economy. It's like Mauritius. Right. Mauritius is going to get like high quality tourism. So there will be like these hubs that will get formed in the world, right. Which attract like high quality people and the cost of real estate will go something like Monaco. Right. So it kind of makes sense to own property if you can. It's just super expensive and not to own anything. Very expensive. And also if you're not a PR, it's like it comes at a 25% higher stamp duty. But you can do reads investing. Right. That's what my understanding is. So I would definitely buy some reads and say about it. Even though you know, currently the Indian stock market is like at a point where you should be buying and building your positions there. No. So let me see nationalism. But right. Have an algorithm. If you just think as a logical person, you need to have emerging market exposure. Keep that in India. 20, 30%, 35%. And then you need to have emerged market or developed market exposure. Why? Because currency is strong. Right. There is stability in these emerged markets. And in case of a risk or volatility, money flows to these economies. Money flows to Dubai. Money flows to UAE. Sorry. Money flows to US. Money flows to Singapore. These are strong economies. Right. So having exposure and assets in these locations is very right. So that's what I would say. So job owner of the business percent is other exposure in Germany. Onaji, we are now 100% of the should I be cutting my exposure. And first I start building in the other places. It depends on how fast we are getting new money. Right. But let's say I mean project like 10 years ahead. Right. So for example, if after 10 years you have like a 30 70 split 70% outside India 30% India, that's cool. Okay. Within emerging economies also you should diversify diversify diversify diversify. That's what I've realized. Right. So for example, I'm learning more about Mexican stock market. And for me, that's emerging market play India's emerging market play. So I'll do a split between India and Mexico. So that kind of makes more sense to me. Rig
