SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses investment strategies, focusing on the Indian market (Nifty 50) and US tech (Nasdaq). It highlights that while the Nifty 50 appears reasonably valued on a 10-year basis, global sentiment toward India has shifted from bullish to neutral/bearish. For the US, Nasdaq is considered overvalued, but the speaker advocates for technical-based investing, cash hedging (20–30% liquidity), and capital rotation to navigate volatility. Key advice includes staying 50% invested at all times, avoiding market timing, and deploying cash during breakdowns or fair valuations.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Nifty 50 Valuation**: Currently reasonable (14% CAGR over 10 years), unlike overhyped stocks (e.g., Zomato vs. Britannia).  
- **Global Sentiment on India**: Neutral-to-bearish among international investors, lacking earlier bullish optimism.  
- **US Market Strategy**:  
  - Invest in Nasdaq based on technical levels (support/resistance) rather than fundamentals.  
  - Maintain 20–30% cash hedge to deploy during corrections.  
  - Rotate capital—take partial profits during uptrends and reinvest during pullbacks.  
- **Golden Rules**:  
  1. Stay **50% invested** regardless of market conditions to avoid missing rallies.  
  2. Hold **20% cash** in overvalued markets (e.g., US) for opportunistic buying.  
  3. Deploy cash only during **fair valuations or breakdowns** (e.g., Nifty is fair; Nasdaq is not).  
- **Avoid Timing Markets**: Overvalued assets can become hyper-overvalued; missing rallies (e.g., Midcap stocks’ 50% run-up) is riskier than staying invested.  
- **Focus on Growth Economies**: Prioritize investments in structurally strong markets (US tech, China) despite short-term overvaluation.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
omo dunia or any other chemen you are not like then we will analyze like Nile's attack again okay which is kind of sensible okay nifty 50 again you do the same right nifty 50 okay nifty 50 index so okay so for example I'm already going to do right so this is 80% now 80% on a five year basis is how much 14 14% see here this is not over bloated this is somewhat reasonable okay if we go like 10 year basis right so this is 2014 this 15 wrap right so 164 on a 10 year basis again this is 1314% so this is not over bloated this looks fairly ugly everyone with me okay but now you say where I get to fit they are in the market well that's right but see now you have to start thinking on a on a Britannia zomato basis okay now where do you think investors will gravitate Britannia or zomato this is not where I think they will gravity they are already are okay why because zomato is a growth stock similarly at an economy level also there are growth economies and then there are de-growth economies what are growth economies in 2025 China very bullish US tech very bullish they are bringing jobs to the US structurally they are still number one consumers in the world right they have massive money printing power safety heaven in the world right etc etc similarly same applies to China India used to be an emerging market play everyone was betting on the fact that you know what India's demographic dividend will be there our middle class will rise our GDP per capita will grow really fast right 2014 when Modi ji came right and there was a lot of you know positive sentiments okay now what the sentiments are like on India right right now from an international investing community it's neutral to bearish right that's what we'll put okay so it's not like as bullish as it used to be right so there is no sentiment right so it's like so Moinesh Vavarai says that buy something which is ignored and unloved okay so is India ignored or unloved right now no okay so it's not because Moinesh Vavarai is a value investor we are mix of value and growth okay so we still have to invest our money in growth markets okay so we cannot like not monitor our Indian investments but it's not as if that you are buying like really expensive on a 10 year basis if you put your money in nifty 50 right now it's okay it's not as if that it will go to dust or something okay you will still be able to exit it at a healthy rate not an issue okay with the US markets you have to be strategic okay now you will say that you're going to want to accept like I want to invest in like Nasdaq okay so let's pull up Nasdaq okay so this is Nasdaq right and let me just erase all this okay okay now you'll say that okay I want to invest in Nasdaq uh but it looks overvalued what should I do should I like just not invest ever right how should I build positions slowly uh what what precisely is it that I should be doing well you should buy as per a technicals okay so you should buy on short term technicals you should buy on long term technicals and for example if you consider this this is like somewhat of a buying opportunity you can buy like one big bulk here stay put this is second support level this is third support level so you only buy on technicals that's point one okay that you buy only on technicals number two point is that you have something called as cash hedge okay am I saying that you need to have cash hedge in India probably no you can probably be like 95% invested in Indian markets when it comes to the US market you should at least have 20 to 30% cash hedge right now what does this mean that if your total portfolio size in the US is one growth okay maximum you can invest a 70 lakhs keep 30 lakhs 20 to 30 lakhs has liquid cash in your FD's or whatever which you can deploy whenever these points start to hit okay natural question will come that okay you know why like do all this right I mean I would rather wait for a recession to come okay I will wait like you know till that time I get like good value okay on this market because you are saying that you know NASDAQ should give like 12 to 13% CGR maybe like 15% malo if it takes a lot of days okay but right now it is giving like 20% CGR okay so why can't I wait till that time the valuations normalize right that's a very legitimate question right see the problem is that again like the entire mid gap 250 story okay okay now mid gap had given an uptrend year also okay so for example if you study like this entire space on a five-year basis right sorry 10 8 year basis this this chart right this block here mid gaps was overvalued okay you would not have entered mid gaps till here right or you would have sold to early okay what I'm trying to tell you is that something which is overvalued can become hyper overvalued before it corrects okay and in this entire phase how much potential gains did you miss you missed almost like 40 50% run up okay 56% run up okay and again please this might again look very contrairian but you will you make losses in the market because you keep on waiting okay so that is like a bad aspect no so you would not know that right I mean how much something can get overvalued okay for example NASDAQ might very well go to x from this point okay but what you can use is that you can use little bit of technical knowledge okay so for example NASDAQ yeah okay so for example here let's assume that it moves in an uptrend okay so let's build that okay let's say that this entire channel gets followed okay something like this right okay so let's say that NASDAQ now I don't know which of the following things will play out one option is that one option is okay yeah one option is that it will go like this right and it stayed stays overvalued because if the uptrend continues NASDAQ will remain overvalued for how many years I don't know it can happen it can remain overvalued for five years it can remain overvalued for another 10 years I don't know okay this is this no one can say but what can I definitely do I can rotate capital right I buy it here and if for example I am investing let's say 10 lakh on this trade or 15% of my US capital here then I sell some of this capital like so let's say this is like 15 thousand dollars okay 15 thousand dollars if I'm getting here then what I will do on this 15 this will go by how much so this will go up by roughly 20% okay now 15 becomes like 18 now how much do I take out so I take out like six seven thousand dollars then I play around or like I take out half of it okay then I let it fall not a problem maybe there will be a breakout also who knows okay and then I play that okay so this is called as position sizing this is something that you will learn only with experience once you start doing it you yourself will understand what strategy is making more sense there is no mathematics okay here that okay I don't know you block or know all that stuff the idea is to have some real profits along this trend line you keep on you do not invest more in a trend okay bossaalani a profit big he loves okay not a problem okay so this will give you confidence also so this is one okay this is very important and you maintain that 25 30% cash hedge till that time this is going up okay now if there is a correction that comes here okay so you go something like this and then there is another breakdown and we are seeing something like this okay and this happens after four years okay so this happens in 2020 okay for example this is the 2030 line now in by 2030 right this entire trend over the last 15 years the market have now become more rationalized from an overall valuation perspective everyone understanding what I'm trying to say okay the point I'm trying to tell you is that see there is enough room for people to play around with this and make a lot of money along the way okay if you get to buy like for example now what can happen max right what can happen max is that see this continues you keep on rotating your capital you keep on making your 5% 5% you know profit and you keep on adding more capital here till that I am this trend is followed and when there is a breakdown okay and if the valuations look reasonable then you invest big okay with your cash capital that is that you're having that 20 30% cash positions everyone is understanding or is this getting like little bit more complicated no it will be complicated right I mean this like we have in the last few sessions okay so anyways I hope that this is clear right and this was important right that you trend to follow it okay don't bet on the fact that the market will fall in the next 3 months 6 months we don't know okay therefore like the key takeaway is that you don't you at least keep 50% or close to 50% of your capital in the markets all the time unless there is a very clear euphoria okay this is very very difficult to time okay 50% of your capital should always be in the market why because it allows you to capital rotate some of it okay so for example if I have 1 million dollar as my budget I will definitely invest 500 thousand US dollars this year and I've already invested like 260 270 okay right and rest also I will be investing right this year now point is how do we build like all that I'll explain it in a minute right but important point is that we are always invested 50 percent all that time number two this is one golden rule right number two golden rule is that if the market looks from a long term perspective five year ten year perspective overvalued we at least have 20 percent cash positions okay this is golden rule number three number three we invest this 20 percent cash positions when there is a break down and the valuations look somewhat fair at fair valuation we invest for example nifty 50 right now seems at a reasonable valuation so we are fully invested in the Indian market okay US stocks are not at fair valuation according to my analysis or sorry US index is not at a fair valuation as per my analysis therefore maintaining this 20 percent is critical wh
