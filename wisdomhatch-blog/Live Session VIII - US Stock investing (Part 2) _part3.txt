SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses strategies for investing in the US market, particularly for Indian residents, with a focus on tax implications, ETF investing, and exposure to tech growth. It suggests exploring tax residency options (e.g., through family members) to optimize taxation. The speaker emphasizes the importance of US market investments due to the rupee's depreciation and the dominance of US/China in tech innovation (e.g., Tech 2.0). Recommendations include allocating 20–30% of portfolios to US assets, starting with ETFs (e.g., SPY, QQQ), and exploring inverse ETFs for hedging. The "M7" stocks (e.g., Meta, Tesla) and Nasdaq as a proxy for tech exposure are highlighted. A structured approach to learning US investing is encouraged, with resources like fact sheets and spreadsheets provided.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Tax Optimization:** Consider shifting tax residency (e.g., via children aged 17–18) to reduce liabilities on US investments.  
- **US Market Exposure:** Invest 20–30% in US markets due to the rupee's depreciation and secular tech growth (Tech 2.0) not available in India.  
- **ETFs as a Starting Point:** Learn US ETF investing (e.g., SPY for S&P 500, QQQ for Nasdaq) and leverage structured products like inverse ETFs (e.g., PSQ) for hedging.  
- **Tech Focus:** Invest in "M7" stocks (Meta, Google, etc.) or Nasdaq for concentrated tech exposure, as innovation is centered in the US/China.  
- **Resources:** Use fact sheets and pre-made spreadsheets to streamline research on ETFs and tickers.  
- **Macro Trends:** Long-term bullishness on Nasdaq due to its alignment with global tech growth, despite short-term volatility.  
- **Flexibility:** Individual circumstances vary; adapt strategies (e.g., tax residency) to personal constraints.  
- **Educational Approach:** Start with ETFs before exploring individual stocks or advanced strategies like shorting.  

*Note:* The text is somewhat fragmented, but the core themes revolve around US investing advantages, tax planning, and ETF education.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 it's a different thing. Okay. But for self employment you can tell the conservative estimate then maximum you can stay in India is one 20 days. Every on with me and I'll say I am old like and I don't know live I wonder live here only right about me. So then I will just stay in India. So then if you are planning a US portfolio with vested or whatever open it in your kids name. Okay. If the kid is 18 or something right or whatever can be done if that is a possibility do it there. Whoever can become a tax resident of some other country. Okay. Because for example my kids are young right so in Kalytham I can't be. And myself I'm becoming a tax resident. So I'm okay but many people would not have that flexibility but you might have kids who are like you know 17 18 something of that sort. So you start you encourage them to open an account right there and you do US stock investing via them. Everyone is understanding why because changing that tax residency might be easier for them then compared to you. Okay. Both and I have got to go to work and you know just live there for like you know whatever like six six months and book all the profits and bring back whatever right. So then you can do that. But if you have to go then it might become a problem so you can always say that if you are not in both the cases then pay tax right and there is no other option that I can suggest okay. So I can suggest options that like and finally like I mean you think you've been here you've been here then I cannot really help you. I hope that this is clear. UnilT has a question. Yes. Keep it relevant to this. Right. Yeah. Hi, actually my question is rated on couple of things but more to the by real estate. So can I raise a question now or. I did. Okay. Okay. All right. So I hope that this is clear to everyone. Okay. There is a video on tax residency that I've done. So you've you search. Akshad. How to become an NRI. It will give you more details on how you can become an NRI in case you are interested in that. And you all the options it's your pick how you want to pick and choose okay. This is not a push by your banjo right and all that stuff you know. No nothing like that whatever you like to be a bit of a booker look right. Everyone's individual situation is different. Okay. So I cannot push what needs to be done. But to cut the long story short even if let's assume that you cannot become a tax resident of any other country for a foreseeable future. Should you invest in the US market yes. Why two reasons number one. I know is constantly depreciating it will continue to depreciate. Maybe the rate of differentiation will go down 3% 2% whatever it is number two. Secular growth is happening in tech 2.0. India has zero tech 2.0 autonomous driving cars or self driving cars will not be built in India. Robotics will not be built in India crisper technology will not be built in India. Now high end surgical practices will not be built in India right. Drone delivery will not be built in India first etc etc so therefore it's critical that you have like I mean if you're saying that it any or basis I want to invest. Please remember this shot right please remember this shot right where you're looking at Naznaq versus Nifty divergence this will continue. This is not going to go down. Why because what you really have to answer one critical question forget about stock investing the real question to ask is that what is generating the real growth in the world. The answer is tech more precisely tech 1.0 post 2025 what will generate real growth in the world. The answer is tech 2.0 and most of this innovation will happen in China and US. So having exposure to one preferably both kind of makes sense every one with me this was a very important point. How much even if you're an Indian tax resident I would recommend between 20 to 30% at least. Now comes that okay find agree right now where can I start my US investing what are the assets that I should look at what are some of the things that I should keep in mind. So here is like you should first and foremost learn ETF investing in the US. And here are your options and these tickers are important for example if you go and type SPY right so here you can go and type SPY so add girl. SPY okay so this is. So this is SPDR S&P 500 this is the broad market okay this is still like you know doing better than nifty as of now here it did well better than nifty okay and it pretty much mirrors nifty why because this is the broad US index this is not a tech specific index okay. Similarly if you want to have options of other type of ETFs for example if you want to buy let's say European stocks then you type F E Z okay so F E. So this is your F E Z right now you'll see that it generally underperforms nifty 50 also and it generally underperforms everything else also. Similarly there are like China based index result 2000 is small cap it's called I W M okay if you want to buy Dow Jones then this the symbol is DIA. Now I have that ready yes so for example this is called as fact sheet okay so fact sheet means that for example if you're looking at a ticker CSP X okay so you just Google on CSP X or NASA DAC okay ticker and you will get this type of a fact sheet okay now here you can read this is a one-pager document that will explain everything to you okay that what is a literature like. So all the information is very well designed in the US that's the good part so you in case you don't understand much about the ticker symbols that okay what is NASA what is Dow Jones what is like S&P 500 what is like China ETF F TX SXLK etc then please read something called as the fact sheet okay that will that's a one-pager document I'll not take you through every fact sheet that is there but if you do this this is good enough everyone with me okay so this introduces you. So this introduces you to the ETF universe in the US now the good part about the ETF universe in the US is very simple that it is very well structured there are a lot of very well thought out structured simple to use products okay now for example many of you think that you know what okay Nifty 50 is going to go down okay I want to bet on this that Nifty 50 is going to go down what will you do. You will say I'll short the market yeah short the market means that you sell today by tomorrow but which index will you buy to do that or how will you exactly short it will go to the futures forward market okay that's a problem okay but in the US there are structured products for you to short the market okay so again I have put this on this and I'll send you this list as well these are called as inverse ETFs for the example this is called as short NASDAQ 100 so the symbol is PSQ okay so let me just okay so QQQ Q and let's add PSQ okay so what you will see is a complete mirror image right that for example if you are betting on the fact that NASDAQ is going to fall then what should you do you should buy PSQ okay so this okay if you are betting on the fact that NASDAQ is going to rise you should buy this okay and you can see this let me just show it to you right okay for example 2008 right so you'll see that this purple line to short up compared to NASDAQ NASDAQ is the Japanese candlestick red and green this purple line is short PSQ okay so this is shorting if you are double short by the journey on a NASDAQ okay so then what can you do you can buy double short S&P 500 you can short S&P 500 the ticker is this if you want to short only financial stocks the ticker is this if you want to double short bonds okay that you are against bonds then you buy TBT okay so the point is that there are a lot of structured ETFs in the US which you can buy and here is a complete list it will take you at least 20 hours to get access to all this right financials excel spreadsheet with you and it will save you a lot of time okay so this is like a structured product or series of structured products that you can buy if you want to buy China well and good if you want to buy short S&P 500 there is a product if you want to buy NASDAQ you can buy if you whatever you want to buy there is a product associated with it okay so I hope that this point is clear about ETFs if you are at stage one of US investing I would really encourage you to learn ETF investing in the US it doesn't work too differently from the India investing that I've taught you right you have to how can we join and you so you just like go on my website and do it right I mean I'll ask my team to drop like a note right on whatsapp because a lot of people have asked me but I hope that this point is clear okay when that stage one of US investing is ETF investing okay you start there even I'm investing there okay so this is one right and you experiment with M7 stocks and next M7 stocks okay now what does the meaning of M7 stocks M7 stocks are Meta Google Microsoft Netflix Tesla these are like your M7 top top companies okay what are next M7 stocks so these are emerging contenders okay now here you look at the fastest grow three of companies right so for example there is no M7 ETF okay for that you buy NASDAQ because that's a proxy to M7 right because almost 35 40% weight of NASDAQ comes from M7s okay so if you don't want to buy like Google Amazon Netflix Meta individually you just simply buy NASDAQ okay now comes that okay how about buying the index etc you can buy now so that's what I'm saying that NASDAQ is like trade of a decade okay so you should definitely buy half some positions on NASDAQ why because macro thesis works out beautifully okay so for example like I'm here to see if you take like for example even now I'll just close this case okay so for example this is still in a bull trend okay so you can see that this is still bullish right and trend reversal hasn't happened right now it might very well go like something like this okay so for example it might very well happen something like this okay and the trend line might continue but a channel breakdown has ha
