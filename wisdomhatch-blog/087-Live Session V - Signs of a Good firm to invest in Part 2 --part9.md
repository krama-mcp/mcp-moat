SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses their improved ability to analyze stocks, using Kotak Mahindra as an example where they gained confidence after a 50-60% return. They emphasize the importance of exiting trades without greed, even if it means missing further gains, and highlight the pitfalls of overvaluing stocks. The speaker shares their personal investment philosophy, aiming for 15% CAGR over 3-5 years, and stresses the need to align investing with one's nature. They also address timeframes for analysis (monthly for long-term, daily/weekly for shorter horizons) and briefly compare small-case investments to mutual funds, favoring the latter for simplicity.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Avoid Greed in Exits:** Sell overvalued stocks even if they might rise further; perfect timing is impossible.  
- **Investment Philosophy:** Aim for consistent returns (e.g., 15% CAGR) rather than chasing unrealistic gains.  
- **Human Nature Matters:** Investing success ties to personal discipline and avoiding emotional decisions (e.g., holding losing small/mid-cap stocks).  
- **Timeframe Selection:** Use monthly charts for long-term (5+ years), weekly for mid-term (2-3 years), and daily for short-term (<1 year).  
- **Small-Case vs. Mutual Funds:** Small-cases offer thematic exposure but are functionally similar to mutual funds; the speaker prefers mutual funds for minimal tracking.  
- **Rotational Strategies Critiqued:** Monthly stock rotations are unnecessary; rebalance only when valuations justify it.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 very clear now I'm able to do analysis very well I would say 50 60% the conviction to exit rightly for example Kotak I have picked up at 1600 1620 something like that and right now it is 2100 change now it's a very good confidence that 2024 percentage growth in six months or less than one year kind of a scenario now the conviction is not getting developed in the exit part of it very specifically now wait what should I focus on right now on this subject well very simple don't be greedy okay so for example if you're media profits and if the charts tell you it's over valued it's over valued sell it move on and don't try the stock okay so this is the hardest thing so it's more about like greed that you know what Kotak Mahindra is hold it for example like I'm not saying that Kotak Mahindra is over valued don't take it that way right it's probably not but let's work with the assumption that you find Kotak Mahindra to be over valued what should you do you should sell it okay you have made out 25% returns in six months you feel Kotak Mahindra is inherently over valued you sell it now if it keeps going up 2400 now that 300 to be national losses what you will 99% of investors get bothered with so that's not you cannot perfectly time the exit okay it's about broadly being correct most of the times now that is what people don't get about investing for example people who are crying about their portfolio right now are the ones who did not sell their small gap and mid gap stocks that's one all their profits got wiped out some people who were extremely greedy they bought small and mid gap stocks last year and now they are sitting at like minus 30% 35 40% loss on that portfolio okay so the point is that stock investing is human nature I can't make you like a good human okay so if you are the most smaller I don't know what your stocks are that I don't know I don't like it for example let it be right so for example I sold no I sold it profit my see profit my portfolio is giving 15% if I make more money well and good right if I'm making like a I target like 15% C.A.G.A.R I bring my skillset up to a level where I'm making 15% C.A.G.A.R on 3 to 5 year basis okay if I make more I thank God that God has given me more money I feel blessed and I'm more out okay and I live my life in joy my life okay now there could be other category of people will say you are 21 and last year they will be depressed with 25% returns also so the point is that this comes down to you in nature and I can't make you a better human okay so you have to like just go like meet some Baba and all that stuff right so I mean then figure out like type of a person you are and yeah find that wisdom that's what I'll say okay I can just help you understand like what undervalued okay so yeah yeah Tafiq Subash so once again it's me I have another goods in for drying trend line trend line I'm also in trading which time frame should we consider one week or one month or anything else is see if you are if you are a long term investor like for example if you are buying let's say Hindustan universe stock today so then you need to consider like a monthly time frame right on a five year basis if you are considering it for like let's say two to three years basis or less than one year basis then daily right if you are considering like let's say two to three year basis then weekly okay so that's how it typically goes thank you thank you yeah Subash yeah good afternoon git my name is Subhash Agraval I'm by profession I am chartered accountant I have here somewhere regarding small guess yes investing through a small guess yeah and I did something it says it is better than mutual fund can we explain something about this wall case no so small cases are basically type of a mutual fund it's not better or worse than mutual funds honestly it just slices the mutual fund differently in the sense that for example if you want to invest in rural theme now small case can give access to that thing okay which you might not be able to get it on mutual funds but honestly like there is not much difference between small case and mutual funds it's one and the same wherever you feel comfort level just do it I personally like like mutual funds because you don't have to track it then right I mean you just buy good right whenever you find bulk opportunities wherever you don't want to track much you just buy it keep it that money is done then you don't track that portfolio at all you just track your stock portfolio and you're done otherwise if you mix it then it becomes like a slight issue to in terms of exiting the stocks it's that's my personality but honestly like there is zero difference between the two actually what I hear in a small case they rotate capital monthly they're rotate stocks monthly that's not needed you rotate capital when it's supposed to be rotated when you see something overvalued it might happen in after 30 years I don't know like so and maybe things will not become overvalued for the next 30 years so doing monthly rotation does not lead to anything good to be honest right so there's no time to do it okay thank you okay guys so I'll see you in the evening right awesome I hope you enjoyed the session right and most of your straight back thanks so much and cool I'll see you like in a few hours I think three hours later okay so please double check the class timing right I might misspeak or something when you will show up later I don't do that just take the zoom in right and we'll pick it up from there okay all right take care bye
