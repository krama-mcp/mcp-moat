SUMMARY:
The speaker discusses the importance of regulatory certainty for startups and highlights how countries like China, the US, Estonia, and Romania are leading in innovation due to favorable conditions. They then shift focus to investing in US stocks as a way to diversify risks (asset class, currency, geography, and taxation). The process involves using platforms like Vested (tied to HDFC Bank and regulated by US SEC) to buy US stocks legally from India under the Liberalized Remittance Scheme (LRS). Taxation rules for US stocks are outlined (long-term: 12.5%, short-term: 20%), and the benefits of holding US-denominated assets (hedging against INR depreciation, geopolitical risks, and future tax advantages) are emphasized. The speaker also mentions the possibility of relocating to tax-friendly jurisdictions like Dubai to minimize capital gains tax.  

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Regulatory Certainty Matters**: Startups thrive in regions with clear regulations (e.g., US, China, Estonia, Romania).  
- **Diversification is Critical**: Investors should hedge against asset class, currency, geopolitical, and taxation risks by allocating 30% of their portfolio outside India.  
- **US Stocks as a Hedge**: Investing in US stocks (via platforms like Vested) protects against INR depreciation and geopolitical instability.  
- **LRS for Investment**: Indians can legally transfer up to $250,000/year under LRS to invest in foreign assets.  
- **Taxation Rules**: Long-term gains (>2 years) are taxed at 12.5%, short-term at 20%; relocating to tax-friendly countries (e.g., Dubai) can eliminate future capital gains tax.  
- **Future-Proofing**: Building a USD-denominated portfolio now offers flexibility for potential tax residency changes later.  
- **Operational Safety**: Platforms like Vested are secure due to oversight by HDFC Bank, US SEC, and RBI.  
- **Currency Risk**: INR has depreciated ~4% annually against USD over the past decade, underscoring the need for currency diversification.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ith the startup? It is going to get crushed. It's like systematically being killed. Okay. So anyways, this is not like, you know, a wedding session, right. I wanted to tell you is that people will build these type of companies if there is certainty of regulation. If there is no certainty of regulation, why would you even bother? Okay. You'll move to a location that allows you to build. In certainty, you'll know that there is no 5,000,000. At least let's focus on building like a good product. Okay. So therefore, like the first layer of adoption is going to come from like China, US, maybe you're up, like some countries, like it, Estonia is doing a lot of work, right. I'm traveling there like in another three or four months. I'll keep you guys posted. A lot of work is happening like Romania is doing a lot of work. Right. Estonia is doing a lot of work. Right. Eastern European countries are doing interesting with a lot of work. So some first layer of innovation is going to come from there. Okay. Now, of course, we cannot invest in majority of those locations, right. So what we can do is that we can invest in the US stocks. Okay. So this is like number one thesis of investment. Okay. And then comes two, three basic questions that hey, what is how do I buy US stocks? Two options. Number one, you buy it through apps like West did. Okay. So you download West did. Now, I will, I haven't spoken with West did people yet, right. I will get you guys some discount from West did. Right. So just, you know, ensure that you use that. Okay. And negotiate with their teams. I'll negotiate and give you some special offer. Not a problem. Okay. I'm because I'm an angel investor in the company. Okay. Now, you can also do I and D money, right. All these companies are there at the back end. They use the same broker. Right. The broker is called as well, Thedrive LLP. Okay. Now, this is a US based broker, which is regulated by US SEC. Okay. And your stocks, whatever you are buying, it gets held here. Now, even US citizens that buy stocks in the US, they also work with well, Thedrive LLP. It is regulated by US SEC and this. Okay. West did has a tie up with HDFC bank. Okay. You open an account with well, Thedrive, right. And you transact. Okay. Very quick operational question that is this model safe. Now there is 100% yes. Okay. Why because HDFC is involved, US SEC is involved. Ah, CB is involved. Okay. So all three parties or all three regulators are involved in terms of Indians sending money to the US for buying stocks. How can you verify this? You can when you transfer money through LRS, they will ask you that for what purpose are you transferring money. And then you will write I'm transferring money for investment purpose in the US. Okay. Because to access Indian investors, you need to go via CB. Okay. So CB does not regulate US stocks. Okay. So they are not regulating like well, Thedrive, but they are regulating HDFC, which allows you to transfer money from India to there. Okay. So that's the bottom line. Okay. So yeah. I hope that this point is clear. Right. So this comes under LRS and either save your RBI is involved. So I'm not like I'm not going to like just devising my statement. Okay. Say, now comes taxation, but okay. So let me just quickly cover that. Right. So tax means that for example, if you're an Indian, you'll say I want to buy like 10 lakh rupee of US stocks. And you will open your vested. You will give a give the instruction that first step is transfer my 10 lakh into US dollar amount. Like whatever get away 1000, 1000, 10,000, around like 11 and a half thousand dollars. Yes, something like this. Okay. So this get this first has to convert into effects. Okay. So HDFC will make this move for you. Okay. So you will have to transfer it and you will have to fill out a form. So LRS form will this go and up to 250,000 US dollars. You can legally transfer from India to the US or any other foreign location in order to make investments as an Indian citizen. Everyone with me. Okay. Now then you will buy your stock, Amazon, whatever it is. Okay. And you will trade into vested accounts. Consider vested to be like zero. Okay. So that is the role of vested that through West it's platform. You can buy and sell by and sell or whatever it is. Okay. Now you will have short term and long term tax. Now please double check it because I'm not really like following this anymore. So the long term is defined as more than two years. Okay. And the taxes 12.5 short term is 20%. Okay. So this is what I understand that this is the taxation in the US if you're doing it. Everyone clears so far. Okay. Now you will naturally say that okay, what is the point of buying like even US stocks? Right. I mean why can't we 100% stick to India? See, there are three types of risk that you're taking. Okay. One is called as asset class risk. Second is called as currency risk. Okay. And third is called as geography risk. Okay. Now as investors we need to diversify for all these three things. Okay. So asset class wise we should not 100% be invested in equities all the time. Okay. So idle split would be let's say 60 70% equities 30% some other asset. Okay. Whatever that asset you like gold you like you buy. You buy like an or real estate you buy whatever you should have. Okay. Currency risk means that okay, I and R. What if I and R keeps on falling like crazy because in 2015 when I went to insured I and R was 60 rupees to one dollar. Now it's 87 rupees to a dollar. Okay. In the last 10 years. Okay. So in the last 10 years it has been a 40% correction. So 4% on average I and R is falling. Okay. So this is a currency risk. And if this accelerates this goes to more. In fact there is a fourth risk which people don't talk about this is what is taxation risk. Okay. Taxation risk is a real risk. Okay. So for example this is the LTC debate that we are having. Geography risk means that see if some like you know India enters a war with China or India enters a war with Bangladesh or Nepal or whatever it is. Then R stocks R currency R everything gets we could. Now if your job is also in India if all your investments are also in India if everything that you buy is in Indian denominated assets. It leads to problems. Okay. So for any investor okay you should at least have 30% of your portfolio outside India. Now for example you'll say I don't know. I thought like you know Americans stocks are either and all that. I want to buy real estate. Okay. Buy real estate in Malaysia. Buy real estate in Thailand. Wherever you want to buy. So at least at diversifies. No. Thanks for you. Okay. Now you'll say how's the war going on. War was going on. All that stuff like that. You're just idiot. Okay. So no. So see what is the thing is that for example recently Sri Lanka went through a crisis Pakistan went through a crisis. Lebanon went through a currency crisis Turkey went through a currency crisis and when currency crisis is. So every month the buying power of the currency keeps going down by 10 10 15% on a monthly basis. Okay. That's how risky it gets. Not just because India is a stable country and we have done exceptionally well to maintain our stability. It's great. Okay. That we haven't gone into like wars and all that stuff but this is a possibility that is there. And there are always altercations that are there with India China and whatnot. Okay. So therefore it is very important to hedge. Okay. Because we are investor. I mean, I ran some things and say right so at least are capital whatever hard work we have done at least it should give us peace of mind. So to get that peace of mind this diversification is important. Every one with me so far. Okay. Now comes natural question that okay I don't have time to like sort of you know think about like where to diversify the way real estate could be like so much it's like the way or right to fly it but when all that. What can I do? Okay. So you buy us stocks. US denominated stocks. And if you're setting in India you can buy legally US denominated assets which is a stock. The more the INR falls the better it is or your US vote for you. Okay. Because you are getting paid in US dollar. Okay. I hope that this is clear. Okay. Final point that I would like to tell right I mean this I've already indicated but I'll just quickly like you know sort of share it here. That's see from a tax risk perspective that's if in India LTCG goes from 12.5% to 30% you can't do anything. Okay. But at least right now if you're an Indian tax resident you are building your US vote for you. Okay. You are let's say over the next 10 years you build like a portfolio of 300,000 US dollar. How much tax are you paying zero why because this is just a portfolio that you have invested you have not booked any profits. Okay. So after five years you decided to move to Dubai. Okay. Now you become a Dubai tax resident now your count gets transferred directly and you book let's say you are profit your portfolio is at 50% profit. How much tax will you pay on this entire game answer is zero. Okay. So why because that's what the tax law says. Okay. So please check with your CEO also right regarding this but this is what I know right and it can be moved. It's not a problem. Okay. So you might be in a situation that where you are currently in India investing for the long term. You want to buy and forget you don't want to do too much jig jig you just want to diversification hedge. Great. Start putting some money outside India right and now one quick point that some of you might be having kids and for example I have two kids. Now let's say I am in India I cannot leave India I don't want to live outside India for more than I will be in India for more than one 20 days. Okay. Then I cannot be a tax resident of Dubai. Okay. So if you want to be a tax resident of some other country then first and foremost maximum that you can live in India is one 20 days on self employment visa. Okay. If you find a job
