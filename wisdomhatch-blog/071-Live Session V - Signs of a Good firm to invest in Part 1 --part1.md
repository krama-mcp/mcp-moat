SUMMARY:
**  
The transcript is from a live session discussing key factors to consider when investing in stocks, focusing primarily on macroeconomic trends, fundamental analysis, and business-level evaluation. The speaker emphasizes the importance of liquidity in driving market performance, highlights the forward-looking nature of stock markets, and introduces frameworks for analyzing businesses like Britannia and Zomato. The session aims to equip investors with tools to identify high-growth companies and build portfolios strategically.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Macroeconomic liquidity is paramount**: Government money printing and liquidity influxes (e.g., during COVID) can override traditional economic indicators like recessions, driving asset price appreciation (stocks, real estate, gold).  
- **Stock markets are forward-looking**: Investors chase growth, not past performance. High-growth companies (e.g., Zomato) may command higher valuations (P/E multiples) than slower-growing firms (e.g., Britannia).  
- **Fundamentals matter, but contextually**: Revenue and profit trajectories are key, but growth potential often trumps historical performance.  
- **Business analysis framework**: A structured approach (17-point checklist) helps evaluate firms objectively, avoiding biases from news or short-term trends.  
- **Portfolio building principles**: Focus on acquiring quality assets at the right price, with diversification across high-growth opportunities.  
- **Investor mindset**: Avoid backward-looking analysis; recognize that market movements often reflect future expectations rather than current realities.

 Hi everyone. Good morning. Sorry. Hi. It was a couple of minutes late. My mic was not working. Just a little bit. Okay. Okay. Yes. Okay. All right. I hope my audio video is fine. Right. Okay. Awesome. Awesome. All right. So, just wait for like a minute. I was like a minute late to our meeting. My mic was having a little bit of issues. So I had to change the wire and what what. Okay. So, you'll just wait for a minute and then we'll start. I also need to answer like some questions that were sent to me on the slide. Oh, think right. So that I'll do in the evening time. Right. So I'll do that amazing view behind this. So I'm like right now in my house and. So I live in charge of my right and like in Almajaz three. So this is usually where I teach from. Right. So it's a nice place to live in case you guys are in GCC. And if you don't want to spend like crazy money on rent in Dubai. Right. So I own a place in Dubai, but I live in charge and that I always do. Right. So I mean, I don't I never like live in my own house. The first house that I bought is in Goa, right. Which is primarily for me to live. But otherwise I mostly live on rent. Right. So this is like a rented place. For an Husqind by here. Right. So okay. All right. Okay. Thanks. Awesome. So we'll start right hand. Okay. There can be this was already shared on like the WhatsApp group. Okay. The class group that we have created. Right. Okay. So all right. So just to give you like a very quick recap. Right. Where we are in the course. Right. So see, I mean, when you're analyzing stocks or when you're building your portfolio, there are three, four key things that you need to understand. Number one is macro economics. Right. That okay. What are interest rates? What is liquidity? And there was a very important statement that I made last week that liquidity creates fundamentals. It's not the other way around that fundamentals create liquidity. For example, right now you might be hearing that you know what recession, animal, I recession, animal, I write them in Beech's, those all, and all that stuff. Absolute BS. Okay. So all you need to do is track liquidity in the market. If enough, if government decides to print money. No amount of recession, no amount of depression, no amount of XYZ is going to have an impact. A classic case study that you can always refer to is this. Okay. So for example, right. I mean, you just go type in if T 50 right or US. I will never be mappled. Right. So. This was 2020. COVID just pre-COVID 12,500 levels. During COVID, the world stopped working. Right. And within a year we hit the previous high. Nothing was moving still 2021. India was witnessing the worst COVID peak. And we hit and the markets went up by 50% from pre-COVID. So three phases pre-COVID 12,500 then COVID for two years. Nothing was moving. Right. And the market then hit 50% more from 12,000 levels to 12,500 to 18,000 levels. You can apply any economic sense. It does not make this situation does not make any economic sense. Okay. That's what I'll simply say. Right. The only reason why this happened was that there was a liquidity flush. Right. So a lot of money was printed approximately 20% of entire US money supply was flooded into the market. And that led to stock market rally, which we explained by using the example of what asset price appreciation is. Okay. So this is called as asset price appreciation. And everything went up in value. For example, stocks went up in value, gold went up in value, real estate went up in value. The only thing that lost value was what right. Cash. Okay. So if you had not invested your cash in the market, you would have lost a lot of it. Right. Your buying power went down. Now how exactly did your buying power go down? Well, you could have purchase like a house in Bangalore, whichever city right at let's say 1.5 crores in 2019. The value of that same house, I can. I can say it with certainty that it would at least be like two and a half three crores. Okay. That's not just a Bangalore specific phenomenon. Right. That's applicable across Dubai. That's applicable across Goa. That's applicable across any city that you could. Okay. So that was a fact. Right. And this is a very powerful point because what we think is that you know news. Okay. I can name cycle off like HDFC bank is like this and that and that impacts the stock market that impacts HDFC. No, it's broad trends. Economics is literally number one factor that we need to study. Okay. So just quickly wrapping up so that I can start the class. So number one factor in stock analysis and macro economics. Right. This is the most powerful factor. I ran a macro driven Hitchpot. Right. So that's what I do. Second key factor is called as fundamental. Right. Fundamentals. For example, that is the fundamentals of the business. Good. Now what is it that we are trying to estimate here in simple language. We are trying to estimate whether the revenues profits or market knows market. I don't I cannot say that he this is right. That is right. Whatever is happening in the market is happening for a reason. Okay. It's because this like this idiot city coming from like fund managers. It's beyond thought. Okay. Number one, I don't know more about the market. Number two, stock market is a forward looking animal. Okay. It's not a backward looking animal. You tend to invest in growth. For example, a classic case study is that you might think that it's really a diatic that you know why a VC fund is investing in like let's say, you know, buy juice or ATM etc. Right. No. So I mean, you know, they are what are they doing? They are chasing growth as investors. The meaning of investing is that you put your money at risk for growth. So people will go where growth is. If for example, Britannia, the outlook looks like that it this company is not going to grow at like more than five six seven percent. But on the flip side, people are thinking that you know what boss I see is a matter everywhere expanding everywhere they can enter new businesses whenever they feel like they start selling concert tickets like one year ago and five years ago, if you would have asked. What is a matter people might not even have known. Okay. Five to another will be a weekend like 10 years ago, people would not have known what's a matter. Okay. So the point is that investors chase growth. So don't believe like don't keep on looking at history. Okay. So that's the bottom line. Okay. So I hope that this is the second key thing that when we are doing fundamental analysis. We are basically trying to understand whether a business revenues or profits will stay intact. Then business analysis we do at a firm level. Okay. So for example, if you are studying Britannia, right versus tomato. Okay. Now how do we study these two companies? So this is something that we will study today and then finally come technicals. Right. And then comes your portfolio, right. Portfolio. Right. So these are five key topics that you need to study. We have already covered macro fundamentals. We are touched upon in the last last Sunday class, right. Business we will study today on this class, right. And on business, right. I mean, honestly, like I mean, there is a course that I can create on this topic. It's a but that would be useless. Right. So what I will do is that I'll tell you a simple way of doing business analysis. And if you keep those 1718 points in mind with a particular framework in mind, you will be able to analyze most of the business. Okay. So that's the ideal. Okay. And then you will not like, you know, get into engage in all this nonsense that you know, I took a Britannia and a lot of an income company should not have replaced like so matter and all that because we are trying to chase growth. Right. Everyone loves growth. Right. The entire point of investing is growth. So of course, you're going to pick like high growth companies. Right. And give them a higher P multiple. Right. Britannia, for example, might be trading at a P of 10. Zomato might be trading at a P of 90, right. And this 90 might be right. This 90 might still be undervalued compared to this 10. Why? Because inherently, this is a faster growth company. Now why is that or that you need to understand business analysis at a firm level. Okay. So I hope that this is this agenda is clear. Right. And then we'll deep dive. Right. And just to give you like a per view of the entire next four classes. So this is what we are going to study. Right. So number one quickly. Right. Today we are going to cover these. Sorry, not this. Today we are going to cover these 17 points. Okay. We will look at some frameworks and understand something called as investment canvas. Why are we doing all this to understand what business analysis is. What is business analysis means Kacha is Britannia good company or is Zomato good company. So how do we answer what is good. Okay. So that is the precise conversation that we are going to have. Right. Today. Then we are going to understand portfolio building. Right. There is one class on selling of stocks, which I'll do an international investing, which I will do. Right. So these are like four topics that I will roughly cover. Okay. So number one key thing is that if you're deciding. Let's say that you have like five lakh rupees today. One very natural question comes that boss. I have this five lakh rupees. What should I do and where should I invest. This is like a, you know, age old question that people keep on asking me right wherever I meet them like if they find me at the airport. This is what they typically the problem statement that I then give me and I tell them two things. Okay. Number one. By good quality asset. Okay. Number two. By at right price. Okay. Then they get disappointed and leave. Okay. Becau
