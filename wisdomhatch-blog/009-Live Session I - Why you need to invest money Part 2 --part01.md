SUMMARY:
**  
The transcript is from a live session on investing, where the speaker emphasizes practical, real-world strategies over theoretical knowledge. The focus is on smart investing, avoiding structurally bad assets (like certain pension funds), and understanding portfolio diversification across growth, cash flow, and protective assets. The speaker shares personal investment strategies, such as buying undervalued stocks and real estate, and highlights the volatility of markets (e.g., trillion-dollar companies losing significant value). Key advice includes buying low, selling high, and being patient with undervalued assets like private banks, which historically outperform GDP growth.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Practical Over Theoretical:** The course prioritizes actionable insights and examples over theoretical concepts to help learners make money.  
- **Avoid Bad Assets:** Structurally weak assets like certain pension funds (EPF, NPS) are criticized for lacking liquidity, cash flow, or growth potential.  
- **Portfolio Diversification:** A balanced portfolio should include growth assets (e.g., crypto), cash flow assets, wealth-protective assets, and liquidity.  
- **Market Volatility:** Even trillion-dollar companies can lose significant value (e.g., Amazon fell 52% in 2022), underscoring the need to buy low and sell high.  
- **Patience & Timing:** Investing in undervalued assets (e.g., HDFC Bank) and holding long-term can compensate for short-term underperformance.  
- **Sector Performance:** Private banks in India are likely to outperform GDP growth, making them attractive investments despite short-term volatility.  
- **Real-World Examples:** The speaker uses personal investments (30–40% in real estate, opportunistic stock buys) to illustrate strategies.  
- **Psychology Matters:** The goal is to improve investors’ psychology (e.g., confidence to buy during downturns) rather than teach macroeconomics.  
- **Community Engagement:** Learners are encouraged to engage with daily posts to see concepts in action (e.g., ETF trading strategies).  
- **Critical Thinking:** Question financial incentives (e.g., hidden commissions from agents) and focus on who ultimately benefits from investments.

 Hi guys, Hi, I've got time. Yes, you're on time. Okay. Hey, I did the same question. Okay. So I think some completed question as now. Inflation in sector. Yeah, I think I'm at textbook. I think now right away. It's like it's you are not going to read it. So let's be practical. Okay. You guys are looking for making money in a shortcut manner. Now if I give you unnecessary homework, it will not be useful. You guys are full time work. I'm at home. Okay. So just watch the lectures one more time. Whenever you find time. At 2x speed, you will be able to absorb concepts. I'm giving relevant examples. Right. There is no point. I mean, just try to learn practically. You are old now. Right. And if you learn like school kids, like I'm writing on board, you are also taking notes. Yeah, don't know it. Okay. So like there's no point. Okay. So everything is practically taught. Right. And you will learn through examples. And mostly like I'll at the end of the course, I'll give you like a checklist. Okay. So I'll give you like maybe 20, 25 points, which are hard atting, which will help you make money. That's the idea of the course. The idea of the course is on more theory. There's so much theory floating around. Right. I mean, you will go mad. Right. I mean, studying all that theory. So that's not the idea that you understand. Okay, what is the meaning of inflation? Then I teach you the practically with our own it. So that's that's just listen to that. Okay. Okay. So, but you'll have to watch the video twice and be active on the wisdom, match community. So every day you are almost every day you will get a post from my side. Which will see you see things in action. For example, tomorrow if I write a post on bank ETF. And today like I mean, you understand that, okay, this is what the channel trading is. Now, then you will have the confidence that, okay, I have to buy it on support and sell it on resistance. If there is a channel breakdown, that also happens. So you'll not worry. So my job is to improve your psychology of investing. My job is not to teach you like, you know, macro economics. That is a course in itself. Wow. He's a professor. The world. Right. So my job is money making. Okay. So that's the point. Okay. So cool. So All right. So let's go back to the class. Right. And Okay. So I hope you got the point that you have to be smart. Right. In terms of investing. Right. And Let me. So we got the concept of what is asset class diversification. Right. And what you should not do in terms of asset class diversification. For example, there are some structurally bad asset, which do not solve any problems for you. For example, growth, any EPF, EPF liquidity, nothing. Volatility. Okay. Fine. But volatility, if you can go to something else, cash flow. No. For most of the things, EPF EPF is useless. Okay. It is sold on the name that you are, you have to pay no tax. Okay. But what's the point of no tax? Right. If you have to. It's like mutual fund agent coming to you and saying that, you know, you don't have to pay me any money for my consultation by you are taking money in the form of making me invest in Intrigue on whatever like regular direct regular plans and charging commissions from there. Right. Again, same BS happens and like, you know, Dubai real estate that okay, if I'm Make helping you buy a Dubai real estate like agent will come to you. They'll say that you know what I'll not charge like any commission from you. If you buy it through me. So you're not going to charge like any commission from me. No, you are of course going to make some commission. So please understand whom you're eventually paying. Right. So that's a simple point. Okay. So there are like, yeah, that's that's all I can say. Okay. So same is the case at NPS NPA whatever like you know NPS PPS PF PF all that stuff. It's self no purpose according to me. Rest is your call. This is not a push that you do whatever I'm asking you to do. But at least plot this. Okay. Now to us as investors, right. What is the meaning of portfolio creation? Right portfolio creation means that hey our net worth is let's say 15 likes. Okay. Now we need to have like a portfolio which serves which has a green check on almost everything. For example, our portfolio should grow also we should have some growth asset. We should have some cash flow asset. We should have some asset which can protect our wealth. We should have some assets where we don't see volatility. Right. We should have liquidity in our portfolio. So aggregate. You have to guess yes. Right. There's for example cryptos right it's a high growth asset. So it should not be that you're only investing like high growth asset because if the market goes sideways or the market corrects then you will see like 30 40% bleeding on your portfolio. So even that is important. Natural question comes up. How are you investing your money? Right. See we'll have a separate discussion on that. But if I have to tell you very quickly, right that see my So I do a combination of hard and soft assets, right or harder and softer assets. Right. So I have a lot of real estate. Right. Almost 30 30 40% of my portfolio is not real estate right now. Okay. So stocks I'm buying on opportunities. That's it. Okay. So unless I get to buy cheap. I do not I'm not doing SIP on stocks at all. Okay. Why because there has been a lot of volatility in the stock markets. Right. Now can I explain it to you. Yes. So even if you look at the US market right now. Okay. So for example, let's look at. Right. Right. So you can go to like Nasdaq. So it's called QQQ. Yeah. So for example, here you will see. QQQ right. So this is 2022 right and what you would notice is that Nasdaq itself fell by 36% 37% if you look at trillion dollar companies right. So Amazon for example that in that same phase it fell by 52% right. So what is it that I'm hinting at right there are here. We live in a market or we live in a world. If you are just being very honest with ourselves. We live in a market. We live in a world where trillion dollar companies can lose their market cap by a trillion dollars. Okay. For example, Apple losing 30% Apple is a four trillion dollar company. If it correct spread 25% it has lost one trillion dollars in market cap. Which is crazy. What does that indicate that indicates this central point which is the next key takeaway that stock market is this. This is called as volatility. Okay. Undist doing two things one is that getting my having money to buy here by things here or buying here you cannot perfectly time the bottom but buying it in the lower half is critical. Okay. Also selling it in the top half is critical. If you're not doing this you will not make money. I'm at a liquor. Right. I mean now I'm like 100% confident of this strategy. It will not work out. You don't have to do like you know, you're just tracking the market. That's not the point. But the point is that having sense having confidence to buy when things are low is critical now right on the stock markets. Now for example, right again coming back to that nifty. So for example, this right this is a technical pattern right if you look at it from any aspect for example if you consider the growth rate right and what's the point of the stock market. So for example, if you go 20 20 right and you look at the levels now so in the last five and a half years. Nifty bank has grown by 42% right so in five years. What does this indicate that if you take like even simple averages. It's an 8% CGR. Correct. What we are saying is that you know what and if you look at nifty right so nifty used to be 12,500 if you do the same analysis for nifty. Nifty used to be 12,500 right now it is at 22,000 so 10 divided by 12 so that is 5% was almost 78 80 90% right which is a CGR of how much 17 18% so we are saying that you know what nifty 50 is growing at a CGR of 16 17% in the last five years. But private banks are growing at a CGR of 8% now what does logic tells you. Two things are not even either nifty 50 is going to correct or private banks are going to rise more. Do you need to be a PhD to understand all this basic point. But where will you miss the bus you'll miss the bus if you're not patient. Now how are you not patient. For example, guess since when I've been buying HDFC bank right for the last two to two and a half years has it given a massive breakout. Is that the only stock in my portfolio absolutely not but did I buy undervalued then yes is it still undervalued yes will it grow. I don't know like but on a five year 10 year basis these things. Well average out right for example if you would have purchased gold between 2009 to 2015 2016 maybe like 2018 2019 gold was growing at a 3% 4% CGR. But if you bought gold after 2020 it grew at a CGR of 20% right so the point I'm trying to tell you is that years of under performance get compensated over the next on a certain time frame and if you have like that such a big window 10 years 15 years. What is your job your job is twofold by good quality asset. What is the meaning of good quality asset something which grows faster than the GDP for example private banks in India will grow faster than the GDP why because our GDP comprises of what manufacturing we suck at manufacturing so that's a lag on right. Banks are highest level crooks they will anyways charge you the highest ever money right so it's good to be an investor in HDFC bank rather than being a customer of HDFC bank. So that's how I'll put it okay. No, I won't go to the Catholic right so they screw you on every single thing right so like both British are not together so the point is I'm an investor right in that right so and you spread your risk right that's the bottom line. Okay so that's the simple idea of investing similarly if you find good deals in betw
