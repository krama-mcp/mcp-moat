SUMMARY:
The text discusses investment strategies, emphasizing the importance of risk mitigation, market cyclicality, and disciplined investing. It critiques traditional Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) for their lack of flexibility in overvalued markets and advocates for a "step-up/step-down" SIP approach, where investment amounts adjust based on market conditions (e.g., investing more during discounts, less during highs). The speaker also highlights the drawbacks of high-commission active funds, preferring low-cost index funds for long-term returns. Key themes include patience, diversification across asset classes, and avoiding emotional decisions during market volatility.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Risk Mitigation is Crucial**: Before entering any investment, have a clear strategy to manage risk (e.g., avoid overexposure to overvalued stocks like Bajaj Finance without a plan).  
- **Market Cyclicality**: All markets move in cycles (e.g., Indian vs. US markets); invest when valuations are favorable, not just during peaks.  
- **Critique of Traditional SIPs**: Blindly investing fixed amounts regardless of market conditions (open-ended SIPs) can lead to poor timing. Instead, adapt SIP amounts based on market discounts or overvaluations ("step-up/step-down SIP").  
- **Passive Over Active Funds**: Index funds (e.g., Nifty 50) with low fees (≤0.2% commission) often outperform high-fee active funds, as most fund managers fail to beat benchmarks.  
- **Patience and Discipline**: Avoid chasing short-term gains (e.g., overvalued small caps); focus on long-term opportunities aligned with business cycles.  
- **Diversification Matters**: Access to multiple asset classes (real estate, global stocks, crypto) helps capitalize on different cycles and reduces reliance on a single market.  
- **Avoid Emotional Investing**: Market rallies ("FOMO") or corrections shouldn’t dictate strategy; stick to data-driven decisions (e.g., margin of safety calculations).  
- **Time Horizon**: Direct stock/mutual fund investments require a minimum 2–3-year horizon to weather volatility.  
- **Commissions Erode Returns**: High fees (e.g., 1.5% commission) significantly reduce net returns; prioritize low-cost options.  
- **Education Over Automation**: SIPs can discourage learning; actively understanding market trends leads to better outcomes.  

*Note: The text is somewhat disjointed, but the core ideas revolve around disciplined, cyclical, and cost-aware investing.*

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 you cannot expect it to continue to grow at like a 50% CGR. It's like five lakh crores say it will become like five lakh crores. It will become 10 lakh crores by like in another one and a half years. It was really crazy. Right. So that's the bottom line. Right. So here you need to have like some kind of risk mitigation strategy even before you enter a stock. So what's your risk mitigation strategy? For example, if you have zero holding on Bajaj finance right now, should you go and buy Bajaj finance? Answer is yes and no. Right. Yes. It depends on a lot of things. But one key thing that you need to be clear about is your risk mitigation strategy. Right. I'm not buying it because I'm a previous holder of Bajaj finance. I'll start selling it now. Okay. So like throw the other key, right. But I will not like add unnecessarily. Right. Okay. I hope that this point is clear by discussing about these wide range of stocks. I wanted to outline the point that irrespective of the market circumstances, some things will look, some things will be undervalued and some things will be overvalued. Okay. A discounted market. For example, right now because the market has corrected by 15, 14, 15 percent from its top, there are more buying opportunities. So you need to be a net buyer in the market. When the market has hit an all time high, that's the most difficult market to invest. For example, the US market is really difficult to invest because it is almost at its all time high. Right. So the buying opportunities are very few in the US market compared to Indian market. Now does it mean that the story will not change in the next six months? 100 percent it will change. Okay. So even the US market will become viable. Right. It's just cyclicals. Right. So everything is cyclical. So you buy when you're supposed to buy. You don't unnecessarily mind. And that's the trouble with SIP. Okay. So what is the trouble with SIP? So let me now start commenting on SIP because many of you invest money through SIPs only. Right. The right because it tells you save time. It's easy. etc. etc. What is the problem with SIP? The problem with SIP is that you don't know into exit. You have no clue. Right. Because it's killing incentive to learn anything. Right. I mean, see, can I give you a mutual one? I'll look at it later. Right. So why should we learn right about all this? Right. So what's the unless you redeem your units, you're still invested in with that fund. Right. So that's problem one. Problem two is that most SIPs are open-ended. Open-ended means that irrespective of the market conditions, when you can see that the market is clearly overvalued. You're still investing 100% of your money. That's the point about SIP. For example, what is the meaning of SIP? The SIP means that you are regularly investing a certain amount of money periodically on let's say fifth of every month. Okay. For example, if your salary is two lakhs, one lakh every month, you are giving it on fifth of every month. Irrespective whatever happens. This is the meaning of SIP. Correct. What is that indicate if you think at layer two? Layer two means that irrespective of the market conditions, you will continue to invest. Now, you're giving money to someone mutual fund manager. I don't have any option to invest, but you say no, I want you to do SIP. I've already SIP is a great right. So now that poor person will have to figure out like some stocks for you to buy. Okay. So then you will buy it unnecessarily for you. That's the problem with open-ended funds. Therefore, the H1 that I run, it's closed-ended, it's not open-ended. I only take money when I feel that I can make 35% CAs here on it. Otherwise, I do not invest. That's the bottom line. You can't go against the market. For example, if the market is correcting by 20%, you will not make money. You will lose money like 99%. People. That's the point about SIP. What's a much smarter way of doing SIPs? The much smarter way of doing SIPs is that you do something called as step up and step down SIP. So for example, you go here, right on FTI 50. Yeah. Okay. So this is FTI 50. What is the margin of safety today? 11%. Now, if it is more than 5%, you should definitely invest. If you're buying 5% margin of safety, run your 100% SIP. Or at least 90% SIP. If it is more than 10%, run your 100% SIP. If the market becomes more than 20% discounted, right? Invest whatever you can. For example, every two-thallagged allagget, right? And if you don't require that money for the next one, two years, whatever money you are putting, you're putting it for three years. So at least this is the minimum time frame of investing in direct stocks in mutual funds. Okay. So this is called as step up SIP that if the market is going down, then you invest more. Okay. Step down SIP. What does that mean? That you invest less as the market hits all time high. For example, if the market is at an all time high, what do you do here? You at least you maximum do 80% SIP, save 20% on the sidelines. This gives you further to invest here or here. Okay. So if you can't do anything and if there is a single key takeaway that you can take from this course, like, you don't want to go through that hassle, just do this. Okay. You will make money. Like and the goal of this course is money making. So it's not about like, you know, if I able to teach you 200 things or 300 things more about, if you can implement one thing really well. Right. So that itself will give you a lot of money and course was really used. Right. So that's the idea. Right. So that's that. Right. So this is one way of looking at it. Second way of running your SIT is that you save on commissions. Now commissions are poison. Right. I've been stating this. So rather than me preaching, let me just show you my portfolio. Okay. So like, I mean, I have not like generally invested more because I'm moving out of the Indian market a lot of money. But this is a public portfolio that I've created. It is at a CAGR of almost 14.5%. This is despite 11, 12% fall in the market. So basically the CAGR in the market goes back to its pre-wesit. It would be 2526. Yes. How much commissions am I paying on this? Less than 0.2%. Why? Because almost everything that I've bought is index funds. Okay. So the point is that people who make the argument that you need to go to active funds to generate like 14, 15% CA. And then, I'll be a yoga. Even if you're buying like small caps and all that. And this has no small caps now. Okay. So the point being and this CAGR, right? So I X I R, I'll show you. Right. This is on yearly basis over the last two, three years. Right. So what would I've generated? This does not include the COVID fall and nothing of that sort. Okay. So the point I'm trying to tell you is, um, yeah. So the point I'm trying to tell you is that doing pure index funds, doing this step up, step down SITs, just buying nifty, 50, etc. You can generate 14, 15, 15% returns net. Okay. Which is huge for you. Okay. Because if you're generating 15% gross, but paying one and a half percent commission, it's a huge loss to you. Okay. And it cuts your portfolio by a lot. Right. Metadata, I keep on keep on mentioning that metadata tells us that 85% of the fund managers do not beat the benchmark. So how do you develop the discipline to just, you know, sort of do sensible buys? It's very simple. For example, am I feeling any rush to buy small caps right now? Okay. So when should I add small cap? When this equation starts making sense, right? For example, this right now, like in this, if I analyze last five years, one 91% right now, all I mathematically need to know is that hey, small cap funds on an average give, let's say, 22% run up C.A.G.R. Okay. Five years, total run up should have been let's say 115%. How much are we overvalued approximately 80%? Okay. Now once this is settled, okay, then I will buy bulk. Now, can I give you write it on a stamp paper and give you when this will happen? I don't know. Okay. Now and therefore it is said that patient investors make money, right? Because your decision to invest in small cap versus large cap now is going to define your returns over the next three years. If you make bad investment move right now, maybe in the short term, three months, four months, you might like know, trading give us as a few five months, but over a long term, two, three year basis, that's going to be challenging. Okay. I don't know. Like I mean, I cannot issue recommendations that you sell this, you buy this and all that stuff. I'm telling you like simple points, right, which you yourself can test out, right? I mean, it's not as if that I'm speaking like complicated stuff. Okay. That's the bottom line, right? Now, natural question comes this next. This is all about this one. It's a lot of good that you know, don't buy like small cap, buy large cap. But what's like that one thing that allows us to be patient because we need to think about it from that angle, no, because pomeo is a right. I mean, if small cap gives like 20% run up now, you'll feel the pomeo. Okay, I should go and invest. Okay. But what you should understand number one is that see when things move up, they move up, go down, move up, go down. That is up trending. Okay. Down trending, the outside trending, the outside trending, so the market can go up still even in a downtrend. Okay. So that's one that's knowledge gap, right? So which I hope I've been able to plug. Second key thing is that getting access to investment options is critical. Okay. If you know about the Bay real estate, if you know about India real estate, if you know about US stock investing, if you know about India stock investing, if you know about VTC Bitcoin, if you have access to, you know, 1015 asset classes that you can pick and choose from, each of them will be going through their own business cycles. Okay. So own business cycle, that means for example, Indian stock market might be in a down cycle here ri
