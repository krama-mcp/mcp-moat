==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses market behavior using the "husband's theory" analogy—highlighting that markets can rise significantly multiple times with little attention, but a single drop causes panic. They emphasize the importance of investing in quality assets during market downturns (15-20% dips) rather than waiting for crashes, as waiting often leads to missed opportunities. Examples include the Nifty index and private bank ETFs. The speaker also differentiates between quantitative easing (QE) and tightening (QT), noting that markets can still rise during QT if underlying conditions are strong. They stress the need for disciplined investing, patience, and avoiding emotional reactions to short-term volatility.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **"Husband's Theory":** Markets often rise substantially multiple times unnoticed, but declines trigger disproportionate panic.  
- **Invest in Downturns:** Focus on buying quality assets during 15-20% market dips for long-term gains (e.g., Nifty, sector-specific ETFs).  
- **Avoid Timing the Bottom:** Waiting for deeper crashes often results in missing rallies (e.g., investors waiting for Nifty to hit COVID lows missed recoveries).  
- **QE vs. QT:** Markets can rise during quantitative tightening (QT) if macroeconomic conditions are favorable, not just during liquidity surges (QE).  
- **Quality Matters:** Not all fallen assets rebound—prioritize fundamental analysis to identify resilient investments.  
- **Behavioral Pitfall:** Investors hesitate to buy after quick recoveries (e.g., a 5% weekly rise) due to fear of overpaying, missing entry points.  
- **Long-Term Mindset:** Consistent returns come from investing in downturns with spare capital, not chasing short-term market movements.  
- **Uncertainty as Opportunity:** Market volatility (e.g., geopolitical events) creates buying opportunities for disciplined investors.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 to here it went up like 18% or 32% did you see like anything any major like positive sentiments 22% here and here I'm talking about like in last four years marketer at least gone up like you know 20% plus four five times okay from here to here right it went right so this was a dip right and again it went like 37% so four instances I can show you where the market went up by like 20% plus four times in the last four years so what is it that I'm trying to tell you so I'm trying to tell you like the husband's theory okay so what is husband's theory that husband can do 10 good things okay and he'll not get like appreciation okay but if he does one thing wrong right the wise will catch on to that okay so that's like you know the husband's theory okay so same happens with the market okay that okay all like you can change it if you're off of the gender right also just take it out the joke okay so that's the same thing okay if the market falls by like 20% there is massive mayhem right and people cry a lot okay but market will go up four times 20% plus four times five times but it's not as if that you know you're giving like special reward to your mutual fund manager for making extra money for you know why he goes up which way right so that's the bottom line okay so the quote that hey you will lose more money waiting for a crash than the crash and crash itself is a very powerful quote and it is becoming more and more prominent okay so this is a very important key takeaway please remember this important note again and I'll keep on referring to this two part theory that if you find a good asset at good price by it okay I don't know how much it will fall I don't know if you know when it will recover if you have spare money lying around in three years it will definitely give you like 15 20% cash years that's the design of the market right now can it change maybe right and I'll inform you whenever I think that that theory will change okay so where can you find this 15 20% fall in the markets right now lot of places okay so for example nifty itself is 15% now if you're on my youtube member community you would have already known that I have I'm like 1995% invested I was about 30% of the return yes yeah right so that is one okay that's point one okay so whenever you feel then the market is 15% down I have shown you private bank ETF right next okay so you're right so this is a channel which is getting formed okay so here again if you check so this is this is x6 7% something like no this is just a second right so this had gone down like like by 12 13% if you'd have bought it right in this and this is where I bought a lot right now that's a great place to buy now what people will do is and the reason why people will not buy is and I'll tell you that also right what people will look at is that for example this candle right this big green candle okay this is how much right so in a single week right so this is a weekly candle right in a single week it went up by 5% okay this is on weekly basis okay so this is weekly candle I'm looking at now if you're observing this chart almost 1995% of the people will say are 5% to budget then right away not half the that's like crazy right why should I put my money right let me wait for two more like no two three percent fall then I'll put okay you I'm not getting right I have friends who are still waiting for nifty to get to 7500 levels why because 8000 something levels because covid-may more 8500 get out right so and they miss the rally so when they will when will they buy only at 8500 okay better or right so that's the problem okay it's much more difficult to invest money in a rising market and make returns rather than investing money in a falling market okay I run a hedge fund right I run something called as a closed-end hedge fund right now the meaning of closed-end hedge fund is that I don't take money in every type of market why because I'm not playing the AUM generation game I'm playing return optimization game okay so I'm 37 right I'll be 38 and my goal is very simple right when I'm 50 and if I have run a medallion type of fund when I'm generating a CAGR of 40% a year 35% a year I can raise money whenever I feel like okay I'd will right so that's not a problem right the problem is generating returns consistently now how do you generate returns consistently it's very easy right just invest in a market when it is down okay and waiting and waiting and waiting for the market to go down is the challenge okay whenever I get 15% of the 20% market I'm not sure I put okay when I don't get it I don't invest right so it's not like a system you know you have to invest and all that okay so for example here right so here is this an investible asset for me yes okay I'll invest I'll set tight why great asset I quality no problem from a future point of view let me show you other right so for example SOX right now this is a semiconductor index now here if you take a look right semiconductor index is down from it speak by 26% from the top now are there problems yes if you speak for example one of our course participants work with broadcom right if you're working intake if you work with a sml all that you say deep seek argue deep seek argue I'm going to do okay like it's not as if that you know what guys I mean it's not as if that suddenly like you know this will go down like this okay so just a second right it's not as if that it will go down like this and forever stay here okay so this is important if you would have taken my 20 22 meta bet so meta had corrected by 60% at that point in time Amazon corrected by 35% of few days like one a few months back so then I invested like a lot of money so the point is that whenever you get these type of opportunities you need to take advantage of it now there can be a secular fall right and then there can be now see it's not as if that every step everything that is fallen will come back up okay therefore I'm saying that judging quality of an asset is very important and for that we'll have like a business analysis class where I'll teach you like what are the criteria for you to check whether an asset is good or not and they're also we can make a mistake it's not as if that you 100% make money right out of 10 bets that you will take five will go home okay but the rest five will make enough money for you to offset all your losses and all that okay I hope that this point is clear to everyone right okay so all right so now just quickly coming back right okay now under what circumstances will you not make money so far we have studied like the concept of QE that if quantitative easing happens then it's logical that you will make money from the stock market 2008 2020 are prime examples right 2020 are prime examples but there are situations when QT also happens quantitative tightening also happens okay so let me show this to you right so for example there's that data okay so for example right this this is like Q quantitative easing chart right so quantitative easing this was QE one cycle markets total fed assets kept on going up so quantitative easing is happening right they've increased the balance sheet right financial crisis man then there was no crisis still fed took more debt right then there were good times so the world trade in trade traded more in this entire phase still they expanded their balance sheet then again they expanded their balance sheet because in 2020 there was a crisis so the point being that the fed balance sheet or that quantitative easing or liquidity in the world will keep on going up like this okay so this is not changing this is point one okay and therefore asset prices are not going to come down right at least for the good assets okay now if we just look at this data there are phases when quantitative tightening happens okay so for example this was start of quantitative tightening this is where the fed did not increase its balance sheet now I hope all of you understood this is quantitative easing this is quantitative tightening why because here the rate of money printing has gone down okay it's not for example the rate of your height increase goes down it means it does not mean that your height decreases okay it means that if you are growing at 3 inches per year now your rate of height growth is only 0.1 inch per year are you getting that does not lead to reduction in height okay now here this is the quantitative tightening phase from October 2017 to September of 2019 and here the fed balance sheet was reduced okay in a way right or the rate of money printing was substantially withdrawn but what happened to nifty 50 nifty 50 went from 9000 all the way till 12000 despite qt okay so qe method stock market is going up qt maybe there are phases when stock market goes up okay this is very interesting now here again if we superimpose qe and qt both together you can see this right so this was quantitative easing phase this entire thing stock market went up from this is nifty 50 this blue chart right stock market went up like this okay this is quantitative tightening phase again stock market went up this is quantitative easing phase again stock market went up now what's the macro reason for this see quantitative easing what happens as liquidity goes up and therefore stock market goes up now quantitative tightening is deliberately done in good times now what is the meaning of that quantitative tightening for example right right now there is a lot of negativity in the world right for example Russia Ukraine war is going Trump has introduced tariffs China is launched like deep seek so one could argue that hey this is like bad times lot of uncertainty now in investing world bad times means lot of uncertainty that's the single matrix of analyzing whether this is a good time in investing or bad times okay right now there is a lot of uncertainty in the market okay what will be good times when there is a resolution to China you sorry Russia Ukraine war right whate
