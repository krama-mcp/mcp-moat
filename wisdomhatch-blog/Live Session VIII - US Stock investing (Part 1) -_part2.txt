==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text discusses an analytical approach to stock investing, emphasizing the importance of identifying specific sub-segments within broader sectors (e.g., private banks, insurance, brokerages in finance) rather than generalizing. The author shares their bullish stance on finance due to its growth potential, low capital intensity, and alignment with India's domestic consumption story (catering to the affluent). They advocate for conservative, theme-based investments (e.g., AMCs, private banks, two-wheelers) and caution against sector rotation without deep analysis. The author also explains market behaviors like corrections, capacitor theory (prolonged stagnation followed by rapid gains), and breakout patterns, stressing patience and strategic entry/exit points.  

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Sector Sub-Segmentation**: Invest in specific sub-segments (e.g., private banks, insurance) rather than broad sectors (e.g., "finance") for targeted opportunities.  
- **Finance Sector Appeal**: Finance grows faster than GDP, is less capital-intensive, and benefits from India’s affluent consumer base.  
- **Conservative Themes**: Focus on themes like AMCs, private banks, and two-wheelers; avoid sectors like IT and pharma due to personal strategy.  
- **Market Timing**: Buy during downtrends (e.g., after 40% corrections) and hold for long-term gains, leveraging capacitor theory (gains concentrated after years of stagnation).  
- **Breakout Patterns**: Recognize resistance levels and breakouts (e.g., cup-and-handle pattern) as signals for potential price surges.  
- **Exit Strategy**: Sell based on fundamental milestones (e.g., target prices like HDFC Bank at ₹2,600 by 2026) rather than short-term fluctuations.  
- **Risk Management**: Limit individual stock exposure (≤5% of portfolio), avoid averaging in uptrends, and hedge through diversification/margin of safety.  
- **Behavioral Insight**: High-quality stocks often rise unnoticed (e.g., HDFC Bank’s 25% alpha during market declines).  

Note: The text is somewhat fragmented, so takeaways are synthesized from coherent sections.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
al sub segments. Okay, so a better approach rather than saying that he I will invest in like FMCG stocks or for learning first of a so figure out sub segments in which you are investing. Okay, for example, in finance, these sub segments will be private banks public banks. You will have small finance bank companies. You will have insurance companies. You will have life insurance slash health insurance companies. You will have AMCs. You will have brokerages like in jail one, cams, CDSL, etc. etc. So these are several themes available within finance. So it's not as if that money will rotate from like consumer durables to finance and then finance to like an auto and all that stuff. Okay, within auto. There are four wheelers. There are two wheelers. So that's another segment. So which segment are you picking? Okay, so some of the segments in which I am personally bullish finance. I'm very bullish. Okay, why? Because it's typically a sector which grows faster than the GDP. Some of these smartest most well known entrepreneurs who have come out in India in the last 15 years come from the field of finance or are working in finance startups. For example, pay TM zero, the thread. What else now we write. So all these guys are established entrepreneurs all. All good right finance is typically not very capital intensive right for example to create an AMC or brokerage. It's not as if that you require crazy amount of money. Right CDSL HDFC MC they can all do well. It's a domestic consumption story for example it caters to the rich right for example no mama with it caters to the rich. Okay, so they have paying power right for example India is one of the most costliest countries to have a vacation in. It's costly to have a vacation in Goa right where I am from right and compared to Vietnam Thailand you might already be reading this but does it have it has it stopped people from having vacation. No, it's catering to the rich. Okay, so there are Camelia for example people are buying in Camelia good now breathing pollution but you can buy like maybe three apartment and books, California, that price. Not getting okay so the point is that it's not as if that people don't have money in India people have a lot of money but only like maybe top two percent people. Okay, so unblack money is a very empty here if you include like black money we might be richer than China. So that might be the side of it so but anyways okay so that's a situation so you bet on individual specific themes that your bullish on I am very conservative now right for example I'm taking very conservative bets on India right for example AMC's is my. Private banks is my theme insurance hospitals two wheeler stocks right two less may I have a judge auto I have. Zero motor call right so these are my two themes in two years okay cam CDSL by again I had booked already booked profits but that's it okay I have zero tech zero IT zero farmer now okay I am generally shifting out of India because of tax advantage. As I was speaking about right I mean you guys are my students so I can at least explain it sensibly otherwise if I write it on a public forum that I'm selling India for a pizza but I can write and all. So all that I don't know to okay so I don't know to get into all that nonsense right so I'll basically what's your body right so. Any right so I hope that you get the sense as to why it's not as if that it would trust the Indian market is just I have an orbit Raj in the US market so I am. More inclined to do that can you know sector rotation no okay so you can't know but there are some science right so for example let me show you right so for example if you take a look at screener right so screener. If you take a look at let's say if you are picking the theme brokerage okay or. Brook Ridge slash stock related businesses so let's look at in jail one okay so in jail one I got a look at. Now this is down like almost it was almost 4000 it is at 23 so almost 40% drop has happened okay. Cams if you take a look right so almost 40% drop has happened CDSL almost 40% drop has happened so what has happened here right what has happened here is that the entire segment is going through a correction. Okay everyone understand that segment is going through a correction segment has gone through a correction already 40% now when should you build position in this segment. When it starts to give a run up so again that downward averaging valley cheese sorry down trend valley cheese that you need to build position in a downtrend so this is a good segment to now by and wait. Now can I give you a guarantee that it will come back up in two weeks I don't know maybe it will take two years but the point is that whenever it starts running the run up will be so fast and you might not even notice it right so what do I mean by that right so for example. Take a look at HDFC bank okay is anyone like Jubiliant on HDFC bank you guys have written the return on the right and I'm going to retire and all that stuff no. No one is like bothered about HDFC bank right it is silently running up right so for example if you take a look right so for example it was at 1600 it is at sorry. I think though from here to here right this run up right so 1400 say it has gone up to almost 1800 so 400 divided by 14 that it's 2 by 7 so that's approximately 2526% run up okay in a matter of few months now this needs to be seen in context of the market so 25% run up on HDFC. Bank market falling by 15% what's the alpha 25 plus 15 so that is 40% run up okay so that's the bottom line that people don't even notice when stocks are running up like good quality stocks and it happens and you know what what ends up happening is that this is called as capacitor theory okay so capacitor theory means that okay. HDFC bank now no run up will happen right it will keep on storing all good good things right for example. Good profit numbers are coming up good good things are coming up but in 2022 zero run up 2023 minus 2% run up 2024 minus 5% run up 2025 suddenly you will see like 45% run up okay so 4 years of gain all gets compensated in one single year. Okay so the idea is very simple that till that I'm revenues are going up profits are going up you are buying a good quality asset plus you're buying a good price be it in 2022 2023 to 2024 and you hold it for 3 to 4 years most likely you will make money a classic case study is ITC is a little bit show that also do you yeah so for example. This is ITC okay so for example if you consider right this phase of ITC from 2013 to 2019 80 gave 0% run up 6 years 0% run up now what was happening between 2013 and 19 so you'll say sales from 2013 to 2019 was how much. This much what was the profit profit did not even double in 6 years this is bad growth okay this indicates a C.A.G.R. of maybe 10% or something okay what about HDFC bank okay HDFC bank. So for example HDFC bank if you just simply do a rock computation it has stagnated between 2021 and 2025 so 4 years okay now what has happened to revenues profit from 2021 to 2025 okay so revenues doubled profits more than doubled in 4 years not 6 years okay and stock prices there okay now if ITC type of story repeats so I'll show you ITC what had happened after 10 years of consolidation on average company ITC stock went at least double from here to here okay so you can see so here it's a double over so HDFC stock can a double so if you go like. So HDFC stock can a double right from here to here yes it will double from at least here to where so at least it's the fair price when will I sell so I will not touch this stock till like almost 26 gas plus that's when my major selling will happen at around 26 okay so that's because why because prego it gets absence of 26 of what you're going to do right I mean and maybe you give it like 5 years my double one of the now it should reach like 26 by 2026 get 2600 by 2026 that's my. So I'm not going to get that rough estimate now this is an estimate it can go off but honestly like net net it kind of adds up okay so it's not as if that you're not able to get this story okay so I hope that this point is clear to everyone how to buy sell mutual fund I'm no clip okay so therefore I don't invest in you sell there's no head or leg to targeting it when to sell at what par get price to sell etc etc okay so this is the next point okay when to exit good fundamentally limit of downward averaging sector rotation have talked see hedging I will I you will learn as we move on like you know I will write some posts around it it's very difficult to explain it this way without experience okay so maybe I'll organize like a special class and teach you hedging but two three techniques that I've already taught you is that see you buy either a price correction or a time correction so which was called as margin of safety okay you buy in buy in not more than invest 5% of your portfolio okay don't buy in an uptrend buy only in a downtrend so if you apply all this it is kind of a hedging okay so this is where we will sort of park this but I hope that this gave you an understanding on when to sell stocks okay couple of technical patterns that I will quickly teach you right which I haven't taught so far right so one is called as couple with handle pattern okay so you both the new hour right so I mean I'll just pick maybe coating back okay so okay so this is this is a powerful pattern I will move the slider for some reason but I cannot move why access for some reason okay so basically what it says is that and this is the concept of break out also okay so for example what you will notice is that see this is a major resistance okay why because the stock touches this go stomp touches this goes down touches this goes down touches this goes down touches this goes down touches this goes down touches this goes d for how long after this has been happening田 Yoza what is this this is a break out hey breakout means that breakout means that's the this was the residence
