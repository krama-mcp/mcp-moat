==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text is a fragmented transcript of a lecture or presentation on investing, primarily focused on US stocks, indices, and diversification strategies. The speaker discusses timing investments during market dips, using earnings reports for stock decisions, and emphasizes index investing for beginners. They also promote their community, in-person events in Dubai, and additional resources like WhatsApp updates and Excel sheets. The speaker advises against trusting unverified WhatsApp groups, stresses the importance of diversification (including crypto), and shares personal anecdotes about combining travel with financial research. The Q&A portion covers topics like property investment in Dubai, accessing session recordings, and notes sharing among participants.  

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Investing Strategy**: Consider building positions when markets are down (e.g., 25–30% from peaks) and dollar-cost average if the downtrend continues.  
- **Index Focus**: Beginners can capture 70–80% of US market returns via broad/sectoral indices without needing individual stocks.  
- **Earnings Reports**: Critical for timing US stock moves; tools like "Public City" can help analyze forecasts (e.g., NVIDIA's earnings).  
- **Diversification**: Allocate across Indian markets (50–60%), international assets (20–30%), and crypto (5% as a learning tool, preferably Bitcoin).  
- **Community & Events**: The speaker promotes paid in-person events in Dubai for networking and advanced topics (tax residencies, crypto) but acknowledges cost concerns.  
- **Self-Reliance**: Encourages independent research over blind trust, warning against WhatsApp investment scams.  
- **Property Advice**: For Dubai real estate, prefer ready/near-ready properties and leverage lower mortgage rates (5.5–6%) compared to India.  
- **Resource Access**: Participants receive WhatsApp updates, Excel tools, and extended access to session recordings (non-downloadable).  
- **Travel + Learning**: Suggests merging travel with financial research (e.g., meeting brokers abroad) for broader insights.  
- **Caveats**: Avoid speculative crypto beyond Bitcoin; prioritize practical learning over shortcuts like AI summaries of sessions.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
it is down 28% from its peak is it a great time to build start building positions yes how much minimum money you should invest right now 25 30% then if the trend continues downward okay like this okay and this is like blue okay so it goes like this then you invest in this entire curve okay as much money as possible then one day this trend is going to reverse right maybe like this right and then you have something like this right this right and this is where you start minting money on this index everyone understands okay from the morning session it's okay so you have to analyze all these individual indices like that okay everyone gets it how to get started on the US stock investing okay now comes the completed part you know what you know what oh come gladi log I mean like you know small cast small stocks directly read me and we have to like you know sort of buy like you know Microsoft Tesla all this stuff see it's little bit complicated right because US stocks move really fast okay and US stocks move a lot around earnings okay so one piece of advice that I'll give you is that always keep an eye out on something called as earnings report okay and public city is a wonderful tool for this right so for example you go on public city and type that earnings estimate for N video okay so then you will say that okay in order as analyst expect like the earnings to go up by 10% or whatever right so then you will get up forecast that okay is the okay is it still trying to come in video okay right and then you make a call whether it kind of makes sense given the price level trend level all that stuff to add or delete stocks yes now this is something that I do like on daily basis it's difficult for me to tell you on this class whether or not you should be buying in video all that stuff because US stocks move really fast but honestly like I mean the key message that I wanted to deliver what do you guys see if you stick primarily to index also as an Indian investor you are getting at least 70 80% juice out of US markets okay so it's not as if that you need to go to individual stocks to begin with if you're getting handful of good individual stocks for example Google Microsoft etc etc then you can consider buying it now otherwise if you just do a play between broad index and sectoral index at least you are able to extract 60 70% of the juice everyone with me okay like I mean suppose I'm a guy right so that's it so that's where you'll stop okay so I'll take questions guys right I hope you enjoyed the course right the course does not end here right the course continues right so you'll get like at least 400 posts from my site right on wisdom as community right on WhatsApp channels right if some of you can afford to come right to Dubai right please attend my in-person events are really good right people have really enjoyed it right now you get to build a network that's my sort of value add honestly I lose money running like live in-person events but I still do it because it's really good for building the community meeting a lot of people so if you guys can afford it I know it's a little bit expensive but it's considered it as an investment right how you'll learn a lot about international investing you will learn a lot about tax residencies I'll have my CEO where I'll have like good people so if you can do that then definitely try to attend like an international event you'll get a flavor of what's happening outside India right important okay so like I mean I'll teach crypto's also a little bit okay so that's important right so please see if you can do it right I mean I know it's costly so I'll not push you and neither this is like a marketing tactic or anything but yeah I mean it is it is like an event right and if you can do it that that's wonderful right otherwise it's okay it's not as if that you know you can do it subsequently like if I organize such sessions subsequently you can definitely be a part of it okay that's one second irrespective of whether you follow me not follow me etc please trust your brain this course was designed to at least make you a little bit more intellectually curious about things okay and not just take anyone's word for it right for example I might say a lot of bullshit okay now someone else might say a lot of bullshit right you don't need to trust anyone at the end of the day it's your hard and money right so you make decisions what are best for you okay I generally in my life I have made decisions which are best for me right so similarly I really think that like people who sort of watch my content engage with my courses etc they are smart people right so my job is to show you direction my job is not to spoon feed you right can be a local HDFC and all that's not the idea you guys are smart enough and I think I look so I am I am a portfolio beat I'm a student which makes me really happy so it's just cool with me right so I really want you guys to do that right so do that right important point is that please do not create what's up group you will get scammed okay so this is happened in the past okay so it's at your risk if you want to join like any what's up group okay so anyways like I cannot say anything but yeah so important point is that please diversify that's the most important angle that I would suggest or honest wealth growth right diversification means that you invest money in India no problem invest 50 60% money whatever it is invest at least 20 30% outside invest 5% in crypto take it as a learning lesson right by cryptos I mean only bit okay no other cryptocurrency learn about tax residency if you travel for example always merge your travel with learning for example if you are going to Malaysia just see and visit like some land okay if you are going to Thailand contact like two three brokers and see something okay I don't know like I mean how your husband wife will feel about that but like if you can't I mean I always do that like so I I'm always like on work right my wife gets very frustrated you know I do it for like research purpose it's like fun for me so if you can do that it gives you like a lot of insights right and yeah so that's that's where I would say I would not like overstretch things I'll try to take like as many questions as possible right now let's make it like chat oriented only so honestly yes Kishore I'll try to answer and yes you will receive like regular communications from my side three four key things right so one is that please join the whatsapp channel right you will receive regular updates from my side starting tomorrow number two the excel spread sheets that I've used on this course I will send it to you you can take a look right and that's two third when it comes to wasted and incorrect money I incorrect money I've sent the link so just open it you will get 2% discount so this is maximum that they were offering but you can use that and wasted copy I'll check with the team and us and tell them right key what best traits they can offer so do that okay so and not a push that you take like any of my courses and nothing of that sort I'm like no interest in like selling anything if you feel valuable and then take it otherwise leave it okay so nothing you are hopefully I was able to do justice to your time more than anything else R.O. is the one you guys are all right un-engine yes yeah can you be yeah I can yeah thank you oxard it's been a very insightful session over the past two days I'm actually attending the event in Dubai but let me pre-empt the question that I have in mind so I have our properties in Bangalore which are actually matching me rent okay so I'm thinking based on your you know I'm based also in Dubai so whether I should partially sell these properties and buy a property in Dubai or should I take a mortgage against these properties from bank in Dubai and buy a property in Dubai this is my first question you are already in Dubai and that's what you say right and you are having a cash history here right I mean the then you take in Dubai right the rate of interest is much more sensible here so you'll get like property loan at what like five five and a half yeah five and a half six yeah and you can easily find a property like around seven percent ROI right so it makes a lot of sense to take loan in Dubai right this try to see if you're buying in this market try to find near ready property or already ready property don't buy like you know far-fetched three four years type of properties okay thank you my second question is I mean it's a very operational dessert's recordings can you suggest some bite-sized recordings that you could refer I know to refer to refreshes today's learnings oh no so like honestly I think some girls might be there who take like very good notes I'm stereotyping right please share it with me I'll share it with the class okay so no butch one day like I know I'm like I always take it from like my female colleagues all these notes so they write like have very nice handwriting generally and all that so I try to share it with you if someone some some class student shares it with me right so I'll send it to the class okay the third question is basically about it's about you know for how long with this recordings be available and is it possible that we can is it possible that we can get a downloadable version of this recording so you can use downloadable no right but you have like one year right but for some reason you're not able to watch it yeah or as you will both then I'll extend it that's not an issue okay so I get fine it's not a problem at mind I'll extend it I cannot down make it downloadable for you I circulate it and all that stuff yeah okay the bottom reason why I'm asking is because if it can be downloadable then you can use AI to summarize the that's the only reason but I think you have to it will probably get circulated but see you know summarizing of the videos would not really make sense right I mean just watch it once twice beca
