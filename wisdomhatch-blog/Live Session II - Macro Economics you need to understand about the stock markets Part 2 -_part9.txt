==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a conversational exchange between a financial advisor (possibly Rahul or Neil) and participants discussing investment strategies, stock analysis, and real estate. The advisor emphasizes investing in high-quality assets at reasonable valuations, avoiding overpriced investments, and booking profits timely. Specific topics include evaluating Google's declining search revenue, Netflix's monopoly potential, real estate investment strategies in India and Dubai, and course offerings on portfolio building and US stocks. The dialogue also touches on individual queries about Mastercard shares and Google's cybersecurity investments.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Investment Principles:** Focus on high-quality assets growing faster than the economy, avoid overpaying, and periodically book profits for wealth creation.  
- **Stock Insights:**  
  - Google faces challenges in its core search business but is diversifying (e.g., cloud, AI).  
  - Netflix is seen as a monopoly with strong long-term potential.  
  - Amazon, Microsoft, and Meta are preferred over Google due to market share trends.  
- **Real Estate:**  
  - Positive cash flow is critical; in India, aim for 4-5% rental yields (higher for apartments).  
  - Dubai offers favorable conditions (e.g., 7.5% yield vs. 5.5% loan rates).  
- **Education:** The advisor offers courses on macroeconomics, portfolio building, and US stock investing, with live portfolio reviews.  
- **Individual Queries:**  
  - Mastercard shares were not analyzed by the advisor.  
  - Cybersecurity investments (e.g., Googleâ€™s Mandiant) were not directly linked to stock performance.  
- **Miscellaneous:**  
  - Flexibility in adapting investment theses with new information is encouraged.  
  - Overvaluation/undervaluation is subjective; broad analysis suffices.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
el like eventually so the competition is also heating up right so that's that's how I would get to so but yeah I'm happy to change my thesis right I mean as more information comes in right Rahul Soneel please wait yeah yeah actually thanks for like giving the opportunity to ask you a question on technical terms frankly I'm not so so deep in deep knowledge about the stock or anything I have limited time of maybe like 12 years with respect to my age so I'm just trying to understand what would be the way where I may not be able to like be alpha or like get some high returns but at least with limited knowledge I would like to understand what would be the ways by which I can create a good amount of wealth maybe investing in India or abroad so that is what I'm looking for yeah so it's very simple right two three points number one by good quality assets right now what a good quality assets which typically grow faster than the economy number two by them at not overvalued price I'm not saying buy undervalued because no one knows what undervalued is okay but at least not buy overvalued right number three book profits when time comes so if you do these three things you will make very good money okay is it complicated to do and it does it require like 24 seven effort not at all right even if you're monitoring your portfolio once a week you should be able to do it okay and I will teach this on the course today was this class one right where we studied macro economics from tomorrow you'll dive into like portfolio building all that so you will have like fair enough idea because this overvalued and undervalued I heard a lot in lot many videos but frankly I haven't caught yet how do how to like understand whether this is undervalued or overvalued you know no one knows right and tomorrow I'll explain you the reason also for today for example I explained you why Nazdaq according to me slightly overvalued but nifty 50 is not right so hopefully that explanation kind of made sense right but point being that overvaluation undervaluation no one can really figure it out you can just broadly analyze it right that's the best you can do and as long as you're not investing like in broad as long as you're not investing in overvalued things you'll be fine right okay thanks a lot so Neil can you unmute yeah I actually if you remember we met at Bangalore I hope I love the book so I have two questions one I work at Google and I want to understand what your thought process about Google particularly with cloud being kind of in a fuzzy territory based on the results that they've published yes like what's your view as an outsider and perhaps you could talk about something that I'm all the same yeah man so see I mean I'm not worried about the cloud part of Google I'm worried about like the search engine space for Google right because that is the primary mover for Google I think they make approximately 65% of their revenues from search Google search that is fading fast so I don't know like I mean how much time would take them to rebuild that capacity over time so there is short term pain for Google that's how I think right so therefore I'm not buying it okay so as of now despite it getting a little bit discounted I am more comfortable buying like something like Amazon or Microsoft which will take or meta which will take market share away from Google even Netflix is going to take market share away from Google when it comes to add-based spend right Netflix is very good according to me it says that it does it's not getting discounted I'm desperately waiting for it to get discounted but it's a monopoly stock right I'm genuinely feel that it will stick right it's it's Netflix time in the next one two decades it has already established that brand and it is not going to come down right I mean there is no reason why it will come down there is no one coming after its core business problem with Google is that everyone is coming after its core business right yes oh yeah so now Google is also expanding for example with me more they are like you know trying to compete with Tesla or whatever right but like I mean it's just too big but it's too small a revenue stream for them now so not sure it looks like I would definitely not buy Google at a high price that's the point so from from that perspective I mean I I observed you've been using publicity quite a lot you've been talking about using publicity and I think that's been overall trend with a lot using Jennyi for their search I myself do it Gemini and or Charge GPT so I think that trend is astute that's that's going to happen soon or the start to impact in some way is what I understand super someone who is looking at moving to the buy particularly setting up a business in Dubai either as a free hunter or as a registered company whatever the licenses are would you be able to recommend somebody trusted that somebody could work with to do so so drop me a message I'll help you so we should I drop you a message on LinkedIn yeah LinkedIn you can if you don't hear a bad from me by like next week just remind me once okay so just write that you're my student right I'll help out not in sure thank you so much sheetal and munishaji yeah hello I have the same kind of question I first I do have some master car shares from his companies so they are reading you for this quarter and he already wasted some on some of the shares so definitely government has already got all the taxes but now after that after the highest point it got rick there's a quite a correction on master car shares so I need some advice like she'll be hold it or what's the man do we honest I have not studied master guard right so like I have no viewpoint on master guard as of now oh okay okay thank you but I'll study it yes munishaji yeah action first of all you know I have learned a lot from your courses I did enroll for the Jan course and I've again enrolled for the same course in March you know because they said that you know you would look at the current market you know conditions and even though I mean I've you know enrolled second time what I've learned you know today is you know completely different from what I learned in in Jan which is fantastic thank you thank you but I want to join your US stock course or your international stock course and you just mentioned that that you know I can't do that as an Indian citizen no no you can do that I cannot review your portfolios as an Indian citizen trade time and I cannot give you a licensed portfolio advice for Indian tax residents right so that was the point right so when is your international it's already it's already going on so just drop me a message I'll sort it out for you but if it's already going on then I mean you know then I'll ask my chance no no no so it's not like that so basically it's a year-long course basically I reveal I'm building a portfolio of one million US dollars right life in front of everyone and every month we meet review my portfolio right on US and that's primarily US based investing so it's a life course every month we meet it's more like a discussion module every month I update this is a course where you currently are that is more like a you know how to build a portfolio life okay okay all right so I can still enroll into that course once I get to wisdom hatch you know there'll be something there thank you people who don't know monisha ji is a very famous designer so like you can look her up right so no no no she's a very famous designer right so I looked at up a lot of people know that I have like zero sense of fashion as you can see I do leave there like one type of clothes just look her up she's like a celebrity right so not a child sorry okay thank you so much thank you yeah sure well yeah hi I'm at Nara and I live in Europe I actually want to enter in the real estate in India so how should be the distribution between loan and cash should it be like 50% cash 50% loan or what are the parameters to be sure so see I mean honestly it depends on the cash flow right so for example let's say like I'm in a great example to pick is UAE real estate Dubai real estate in Dubai it's not impossible to find deals right where you are making a cash flow for example you buy an apartment you rent it out at seven and a half percent yield I have done it right so I'm speaking from my example and the borrowing rate in Dubai for real estate is five and a half right five five and a half right so basically what is happening there in that equation is that it's a net positive cash flow deal for me because I'm borrowing at five and a half and I'm renting it at seven and a half so my rent offsets the EMI and it still puts money in my pocket okay but in India what ends up happening is that if you're buying like a typical township project your yield will be two percent rent and you're borrowing at nine so there is a minus seven percent outflow so the entire question should you cash finance it should you like you know how much loan should you take etc depends on this equation to begin with okay so the equation that I will suggest in India is that at least your cash flow on the property should be four percent if it is not giving you four percent five is four percent on a villa and five percent on an apartment if it is not giving you five percent on a apartment it's a bad deal if it is not giving you four percent on a villa it's a bad deal okay now why four percent for a villa because villas appreciate faster compared to apartments so therefore that underlying property appreciation is faster on villas so that's okay to take like one two percent hits but that's a general rule I will suggest but it depends on a lot of things but hopefully it gives you an idea yes yeah thank you okay no so unfortunately I'm not able to cover like real estate guys recently purchase a cyber security 32 will this benefit the Google stocks I think Google in cider will tell us right I don't know like so I'll wheel here and hear it f
