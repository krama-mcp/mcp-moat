==================================================

SUMMARY:
The speaker discusses investment strategies, emphasizing that buying during market corrections of 20% or more historically yields returns. They caution against overvalued mid-cap and small-cap stocks in India due to weak manufacturing growth and prefer long-term investments in markets like the Nasdaq or China. The speaker also critiques short-term speculation, advocates for patience during market consolidation, and questions the hype around SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) and certain stocks like Zomato, stressing data-driven decisions over emotional investing.

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Market Corrections**: Investing during 20%+ market corrections historically ensures returns, provided you have capital and a long-term perspective.  
- **Overvaluation Risks**: Mid-cap and small-cap stocks in India are currently overvalued with poor manufacturing growth (2.5–3%), making them unattractive for long-term bets.  
- **Global Alternatives**: Prefers investing in growth markets like Nasdaq or China over Indian small/mid-caps due to better long-term prospects.  
- **Patience in Consolidation**: Advises waiting for sideways or downward corrections in overvalued segments before buying.  
- **Critique of SIPs and Hype**: Suggests SIPs are overhyped and may not guarantee returns, emphasizing merit-based investing.  
- **Zomato Debate**: Acknowledges Zomato’s revenue growth but warns of competition risks (e.g., Amazon, Tata), advocating probabilistic analysis over blind faith.  
- **Capital Protection**: For no-profit-no-loss portfolios, suggests evaluating reinvestment options rather than exiting impulsively.  
- **Data over Stories**: Stresses the importance of fund manager performance tracking and avoiding oversimplified strategies like "coffee can investing."

ORIGINAL TEXT:
en should I invest it whenever this 20 percent 25 percent correction happens okay and final golden nugget that I will give you is that see anytime like literally anytime when the market has corrected by more than 20 percent right any pick any okay in the US you will always make returns for example this was a 20 percent fall this was a 20 percent fall right if you go back study any history this was a 20 percent fall if you invest at any 20 percent fall you will 100 percent make returns okay that's that's going to happen so the only reason why you would not be able to make 20 percent sorry you would not be able to make returns when the market falls by 20 percent as you run out of money okay and you will never run out of money if you are not investing from a long term if you are not checking the over valuation zone okay a little bit complicated stuff so I'll take like one two questions okay and then we will break out for a break okay okay on this mid gap can you help understand the short term play considering see short term is very difficult to do right and mid gap I'm not doing I'm a long term sensible investor for example if the index looks 2x bloated will I go and will I go and invest more on small cap mid caps now no I would rather by like time correction what I will what is my strategy on mid caps now okay so I'll just weekly tell you so for example mid cap is going to go mid cap 150 this is mid cap 150 now what what is it what is my expectations the number one is that see this is likely to go sideways this is what I'm anticipating this is definitely overvalued right now right now is this the bottom I don't know but we can consider this to be the temporary bottom now it might go up like this now it might go like like this because I'm anticipating a sideways consolidation so buying zone for me will be this okay the next time it hits there you will say that a chasagani then maybe this channel will get formed I don't know right so it will go something like this okay then I will buy this right or whatever it is right so we have to wait here right I mean there because there is no clear picture that is emerging here right and it is very much overvalued so there is no point and also there are no long term growth prospects that that are bullish right because majority of the mid cap and small cap companies are manufacturing manufacturing sucks and India right now okay so there is no long term play for example if I have to speculate on valuations I would rather go and invest in Chinese market I would rather go and invest in Nazdaq because long term growth growth people are going to chase but in small mid caps in India the manufacturing sucks and it and if the manufacturing growth rate in India is 2.5% right now right so and it goes to like 3 it's hoarded okay so it's like worse than the US economies growth rate so why would it keep on growing at 20% CSER right so it doesn't make much sense okay so therefore I don't see any point in speculating I'm adding I'm using like macro knowledge business analysis technicals and then I'm making like my buy cell calls everyone is getting us okay so I'm trying to give you a flip okay okay paratha yeah recently I saw an interview where some of the one of the new news channels was a person from some foreign investment firm very called Zomato as a one dollar business and to be honest somewhere I feel Zomato doesn't have a basic or a business at what you say at the core core of the businesses just delivering food food is one started with that okay now it's been expanding its wins so I just want to know on what what basis was that comment given by your Paris but if I'm not wrong it's it was a Paris fund investment guy who who gave that who said that it is a one dollar business and it has no growth as far as I see I mean honestly like people say 100 different things I'm not here to like you know criticize or defend anyone's comments right up you just and honestly like bottom line is very simple right that if you are betting on India's consumption then which businesses are you going to pick every business will be like this only right so if you like this is at least a segment and which jobs are getting created this is at least a segment in which the overall revenues are growing at a crazy pace it's not my opinion versus his opinions just open up the recent results if the revenue growth is growing at like you know 100% a year close to right I don't have to defend that business right I mean that's that's that right I mean it's not about defending it but what if it is at one point what if big players enter into this business for example Zomato has started with Zepto and similarly now there is big basket from Tata and now what if Amazon also enters into this 10 minute delivery thing and the small time it lets Zomato can definitely give up some market to them not really man I mean see even like they are a category leader at something so till that I mean they are there uses by good valuation I'm not saying that go in my Zomato or never sell it I myself sold Zomato that's not the point I made like 100% returns on it when that time comes I'll add more of it right I have little bit of positions on Zomato I have positions on Spighi we'll see how the market evolves why speculative right for example by that logic because Amazon is there like then you know no one should not exist in UA right or like nothing should exist then only Zomato should I mean Amazon should do business every right so that doesn't it wasn't worth that very right okay thank you sir I'll take like couple of two quick questions and then we'll take a short hiya Gideeshha hi Akshad very quickly so in this so let's say today with my small and mid gap portfolio I am at no profit no loss right so considering that we just went through how the small mid gap both are over valued and might be like a two three or consolidation pace or a time correction pace would you suggest that I get out of the entire investment very hard to because a very hard hard to do because you know it was at a 20 25% positive and then look at fresh ways of you know deploying that capital the woodback makes sense I don't like I mean see because you are you have to play with it's a probabilistic analysis okay it's not stock market is not short short thing okay you just have to play with the probabilities right for example if I give you an advice that okay ZDS it looks overvalued then you might get out of it tomorrow right and suddenly there is a 5% run up for whatever reasons and say yeah it's like mad right I mean he gave me a strong advice I cannot say anything on that right but I can simply say is that see this is what data tells us that he on a ten year basis is it overvalued yes on a short term basis it overvalued yes on a three year basis is it overvalued yes okay let's look at things from our fund managers point of view if someone is running a mid gap small cap fund they are CGR because they are not withdrawing money from the market right like technically speaking their fund is still giving like 30 35% CGR because they are they will show you return on pre-COVID basis so for them they are showing that 40% 30 whatever like you know 30 35% CGR so their returns make sense so they are no incentive to pump the market mid gap small cap so chances to me on capital correction or sorry consolidation is very high and the chances for like sideways slash downward might happen because price correction or time correction should happen that's what I think should you exit it completely I don't know right I mean that really depends on where you will reinvest this capital etc etc right if you buy wrong I can't help you out right I mean if you don't book profits at the right time I can't help you out right I mean then it becomes a difficult conversation right with with lines understood understood so not looking at like like a recommendation from your end but let's say if you were in this situation how would you even look at it like how how do I look at it to let's say at least protect my capital where it is like how how would you sort of begin to analyze it you know like see I'll put in you where it has the highest so I'll probably like start the class there the next class there right so allowing some time if it doesn't get answered I'll answer it in the end okay sure one quick question I'll take so one and then I'll yeah actually our last week classes I got know what capital rotation is I did some bit of capital rotation last one week but one my question was there are the strategies called coffee can investing and things like that so are there signs which I need to look forward to say that hey this talk is a blind long term investment like 10 years so do one thing read coffee can investing number two then Google like who wrote coffee can investing the number three search performance of this fund manager in the last five years then you'll say that okay the market gave like 23% C.H.R.S fund perform minus nine okay then you should ask that should you be taking advice no okay I'm not trying to be sly or like you know beans in here that's what it is right I mean it's a merit oriented industry if you can't perform then get out right that's the bottom line right so otherwise why are you why are people paying you two percent of the AUM like just to tell stories right so doesn't make sense no I mean see it's very simple right I mean if something has been oversimplified it's not going to give you returns when I say people get mad at me that you're missing on SIPs SIPs are being overdone okay it is not going to give it on so like that's what I feel okay do I have data to prove it now no this books will be written after 15 20 years okay on this right I don't know like so but am I that's like that's true for careers that's true for any comparative good thing that you're doing money making is a competition okay like it or not I'm not trying to like know like so you'll be that idealist again th
