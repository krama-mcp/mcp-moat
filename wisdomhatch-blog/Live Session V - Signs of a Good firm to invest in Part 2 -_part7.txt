==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a fragmented discussion covering various aspects of stock market investing, including:  
- Differences in evaluating small/mid-cap stocks versus large-cap stocks.  
- The importance of business analysis and categorization of stocks (e.g., cyclical, tech, compounders).  
- Risk-reward analysis (fundamentals first, then technicals).  
- Challenges with tier 2/3 city real estate investments (liquidity issues).  
- Clarifications on stock pricing, unlisted shares, and brokerage practices.  
- Brief advice on index fund investing and swing trading platforms.  

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Stock Evaluation Parameters Vary**: Small/mid-cap stocks require different metrics (e.g., ROC may not apply) compared to large caps.  
- **Business Analysis is Critical**: A thorough analysis of 17-18 key points helps avoid poor investments, even for cyclical stocks.  
- **Risk-Reward Equation**: Combine fundamental analysis (screening) with technicals (2:1 reward-to-risk ratio).  
- **Real Estate Caution**: Tier 2/3 cities face liquidity challenges; selling properties is difficult despite price appreciation.  
- **Stock Price vs. Valuation**: Absolute stock price is irrelevant; focus on valuation metrics.  
- **Brokerage Practices**: Compare commissions, liquidation support, and reputation when choosing platforms for unlisted shares.  
- **Index Investing**: Use platforms like Zerodha to buy Nifty index funds easily.  
- **Swing Trading**: No single "best" platform; choose based on individual needs.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
nd one is are these parameters what we would also apply to evaluate small and mid cap or are there different parameters and considerations perhaps the ROC etc may not be applicable so are there different parameters for I think tomorrow tomorrow I'll take you through these one two three four five six seven eight nine nine nine type of stocks so your question your second question will get answered there right but having said this you still have to do business analysis of the 1718 points or and map it onto these seven eight type of stocks that I'll be teaching okay so both these things need to be looked at in conjunction that's point one point was that there are differences between small gap consistent compounded stocks five x baggers 10 x baggers all these tech stocks cyclical stocks so there is a proper time to buy what things you'll look at so I'll cover that tomorrow right in portfolio building okay but having said this if you do the business analysis well those 17 points which I taught you today then 80% you're already there right so you'll not make mistakes in terms of buying a bad asset okay so at least you will understand why you are buying something so that's the idea it's completely okay do buy cyclical stocks no problem okay it's completely okay do buy power companies but you need to understand in what category they fall and do the business analysis accordingly okay so and and and your good best practice to track these you know each each each stock for example let's say HSUL maybe the P is on a different journey maybe there is B expansion that we expect maybe it's not the right time to buy yeah you track these perhaps in an excel or do you just run screeners when you're ready to I don't run screeners basically like there are stocks that will that that I'm anyways tracking right for example 30 40 50 stocks so it's a watch list that my I might have now if there is any significant price movement for example if I don't have any for example I sold in FD 50 right on a trade now if I want to invest it somewhere so now I'm studying like private banks it looks very undervalued it looks undervalued so I'll invest some money there now if HUL looks undervalued as per my analysis then I'll you know sort of do that but honestly see I mean your goal is not to become like a stock analyst right that's a full time job it's pointless I mean you cannot track so many stocks the idea is that if someone is giving commentary for example if I'm giving commentary on some stock HUL or whatever it is you're able to absorb it and apply it to your portfolio that's the idea of the course okay thanks thank you yeah no yes actually good morning can you please explain about the risk reward equation for which kind of stocks we need to do this risk reward equation and based on fundamentals or based on technicals my question is this yes so risk reward is primarily due to it's a mix of both right I mean first you have to do fundamental analysis right and if the fundamental check is there on the stock then only you will enter that on technicals right you will will not buy like crap companies purely based on like technicals okay so that's one second is that the risk reward equation is done as per technicals so that 2 is to 1 strategy that I'd explained you last week right so that's a technical risk reward analysis right so what do you simply do is that you look at the potential upside on a strategy and potential downside on the strategy and figure out like and if you're going to individual assets there should at least be like you know if the stock is risky then at least there should be a 2 is to 1 ratio that if you win you will get 2 rupees if you lose then you will only lose 1 right so that's the equation that we're looking at maybe I'll cover it tomorrow again okay yeah thanks yeah I have to thanks for all your reaching that's really wonderful I have two questions number one when is the likely timeline for any say I point we can't predict but what is your thesis around that about the timelines for the IQ I don't know I don't care also right so I'll let them I feel whenever they want to I feel that's beyond my control right so honestly like I mean no how can anyone tell you right I mean even if you ask like NSC president or something right I mean even they would not know this is a government decision when they want to bring it to the market okay the second question you already talked about the real estate in the smallest cities but I might wish it was particularly about this full bullet train project which is coming up from Bombay to Ahmed and my thesis is that on that route the last station is like a surat for example or Baroda kind of predict cities or not that Metro but second dial cities are going to benefit from a real estate it was my thesis do you think making our property investment from a rental point of view future will make sense then see a problem with small cities is that you will never get buyers in small cities right whenever you might invest if you have the money right but then finding like another for example in Dubai if you are selling a property worth 50 gross you can have 10 buyers tomorrow okay but if you're trying to do the same in Gwalior right then you will not find buyers that's a problem right because all the high ticket people either move outside India or they move to metros or they will have like some or they move to like holiday markets like Goa or like you know like a pondituary Luxubi exotic locations right so tier 2 tier 3 real estate thesis I don't really believe anymore right because liquidity is a major challenge right selling real estate becomes a major pain point it on paper you will keep on seeing you know what the prices doubled became five times and times but the moment you try to sell your real estate it's a nightmare right and tier 2 tier 3 cities okay thanks thanks they will yes so along with the embassy there are other few pending and listed stocks that have come out which is like this per act for it financial advice really also a SFC securities which are like the the purchase and the purchase price is also pretty high it was 11000 rupees and per act for it is 8000 something like that but yes so see I mean I'll write like separate stock analysis for per act for it right absolute stock price does not matter right for example MRF stock is like one lab propia stock it doesn't matter okay it's like saying that for example 1000 there are not is there okay so which is equivalent to 25000 to P note 25000 if you have 1000 did I'm not or if you have five into you know you know 200 right dirams it's one and the same thing so this absolute stock price is pointless right it's the valuation which is more which matters more okay so then my follow up question for that would be that I have actually gone to analyze with the price that internet is living and it's like I'm shopping with this price with a different company because I don't realize is actually able to give me an SES stock at a lower price than what internet is able to give me I did not know that actually I wasn't privy to that information that that could also happen but is this a right practice I don't know anything about this is this a is this a right practice b is it safe to do that to take this share price and kind of play with it I kind of happen to do this because I have my MLTs with the edelwice I use buy some ncd the MLTs with edelwice so I just asked them about that and they were actually able to lower the price so it was like me shopping around with this so see I mean honestly like this is private banking right so for example if edelwice is giving you a better rate it's fine go with that not an issue having said this check for two three things one is that companies like edelwice they will charge some commissions on top of the base price right ingrid might not be doing that right that's one second is that if you're liquidating this asset and then companies like ingrid can help you sell also now will edelwice do that for you I don't know so you have to check these things and third is the reputation right so for example in credit money is a part of incorrect group which is already a unicorn and they themselves are IPOing soon right so there is like things that stick sharu Khan is an investor like I mean all the router it is a brand ambassador all that stuff don't buy it from like you know other like basic platform right for example there are a lot of companies like I don't know precise unlisted zone all that just because they're offering better price just don't simply go to that check for like these three four things and since you have an existing relationship so edelwice might be offering you like a genuine deal I'm not sure okay this one last question so you put membership subscription as same notes as the website community so do you push your content at the same time in both channels I'm asking this because I should I continue my membership or can I just follow your WhatsApp channel oh no just WhatsApp is fine in your case right because you're already a core student so you don't need all right thank you thank you I actually so I have bought HUN and Asian paints and point of entry was wrong for me so I'm at loss both of them and I want to be kept the 5% thing on both of them now watch it step what don't do nothing okay okay thanks no a topic hello sir good noon I'm a sketch level beginner I just want to know how to buy nifty 15 decks or nifty private bag index please tell me stick right so just go on guide by zero the right where you are you buy from like buy your stocks so for example if you don't have like stock trading account then you need to open one with zero the or whichever company will like right then on that you just go on the search button and type nifty b's and I have TY bWS and buy that that's it and for this get for that gets swing trading for swing trading zero that is better from any other brokerage no so what happens is that i
