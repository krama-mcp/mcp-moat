SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses business expansion possibilities for companies like Zomato, contrasting them with traditional industries like automotive (e.g., Tata Motors). It highlights how Zomato could diversify into payments (e.g., "Zomato Pay"), hospitality, or activities (similar to Airbnb) due to its broader **TAM (Total Addressable Market)**. In contrast, industries like automotive face slower growth and disruption from new entrants (e.g., Tesla in EVs), as their TAM is "narrow" and market share is static. The latter part analyzes Zomato’s competitive moat using Porter’s Five Forces, emphasizing low threats from rivals, substitutes, and bargaining power of suppliers/customers. The text concludes with a critique of government intervention in markets (e.g., Goa’s taxi policies), arguing for free competition over inefficient monopolies.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Diversification Potential:** Companies like Zomato can expand into adjacent services (payments, hospitality) due to their scalable platform and wide TAM.  
- **Industry Dynamics:** Traditional sectors (e.g., automotive) with fixed markets face disruption from new entrants (e.g., EV startups), leading to market share battles.  
- **Porter’s Five Forces Applied:** Zomato’s dominance is reinforced by high barriers to entry, low competitive rivalry, and weak bargaining power of stakeholders (customers, restaurants).  
- **Government Policy Critique:** Restrictive policies (e.g., Goa’s taxi monopolies) stifle competition and innovation, favoring inefficiency over market-driven solutions.  
- **TAM Matters:** Businesses with a narrow TAM (e.g., Tata Motors) struggle to pivot, while those with a wide TAM (e.g., Zomato) can innovate and absorb disruptions.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ne is understanding on top of that what else can they go to for example, you might have for of Amazon pay or Apple pay. Similarly, they can also launch Zomato pay. They are probably working on that model. They can have like give you like cash back reference. They can launch their own credit debit card. It when time comes right. They can do hospitality. They can do to it's like for example, if when you go to Airbnb and book an Airbnb anywhere. What you would notice is that there are activities around that here. You can book those activities also. You know thing class, let's join or like you know, let's go on a local food tour or whatever. Why can't Zomato do that? And now it's not about just running with wild ideas, right. You'll say that you've gone mad because you have like a little bit of Zomato in your portfolio. No, it's not like that. It's about it's also about. The the probability of that business taking such activity and succeeding in it. Right. For example, if Zomato goes into concert selling. Then can it do it versus Tata Motors going into concert selling. Where do you think it would be easier. Zomato drone delivery. Right. So the point is that this is called as tam there are businesses which have a wider time right and then there are businesses which have a narrower time. For example, Tata Motors is a narrow tam business. Now, why is this a narrow tam business because that's imagine that this is Tata Motors. What it does it sells cars primarily. Okay. Over time, if Ola electric is coming right or ether energies coming over level like they can also long be wide is there Tesla is there. Are these companies going to take some market share away from Tata Motors? Yes. Okay. Can Tata Motors in order to preserve its base do something else for example, can it go into space exploitation. Very difficult like they can but it's the probability of this happening is very low. Okay. So the point being that you know, Tata Motors becomes a candidate where market share is going to be taken away. Okay. In a market which is fixed. Now, what is the meaning of market getting fixed. So for example, if you consider EV. Okay. Now because for example, let's say that we are in 2025 and there are 50 lack cars in the world. Now, why are there 50 lack cars in the world because the population of the world is whatever like 7.5 billion population. And they use 50 lack cars now is the population of the world by like 20 30 going to go to like 8 billion answer is no it will remain like almost same only right. And instead of 50 lag, maybe there will be like 55 lack cars. So this is a slow growth industry. Everyone understands. Okay. Now EV has come means what that this is a new opportunity for other players who had missed out on building like EV like for example, Tata guys Maruti guys. Whatever like Tesla B by D they have all done it. Okay, but B by D is a fairly young company Tesla is also a fairly young company Ford Motors are all old. Okay. So new guys come like Musk. They will say that you know what we missed out on selling cars. We'll also enter car business because there is a fundamental shift that is happening in this industry. So who do you think they are going to take market share away from Ford Motors, Tata Motors, Maruti all this stuff. Why because this industry itself is not expanding. And there are new entrance coming when missed out on the previous like you know conventional automobile building risk. Okay. So now they will enter the show and they will try to claim whatever business they potentially can. Right. So therefore it's a the the mood has to be sorry the pan has to be defined in context of the business and but I hope that everyone understands what's the meaning of them and what type of business are we. Why would new entrance come in a fixed market. This is because they can still be profitable. So they come like 50 60 lack cars or whatever number of outstanding cars are there. They will have like whatever 678% growth rate for some people think that you know what okay fine. There is a fixed 5560 like cars. But we can go and we can capture like maybe 20% of the market and that market itself looks very lucrative. Right. So it's like saying that okay. Why would. So it's like a good. So it's a good. So it's a good. So it's a good. So it's a good. So it's a good. So it's a good. So it's a good. So it's a good. So it's a good. So it's a good. So it's a good. So it's a good. So it's a good.

So it's a good. But if we take. We're not saying sometimes we didn't get a. We didn't verify the. So we did it where you had Burr. And if we don't, this is, we're not saying, Okay, so this is port as five forces, right? And basically like, you know, it talks about like there are five factors which helps a company remain competitive. For example, if new entrants cannot enter, so am I told now, do you think it's easy for me to enter and build something like a delivery network of like whatever, 50 lakh drivers or something. Short answer is no, this is massively capital expensive, right? I cannot do it. This has to be crazy, okay? Comparative rivalry. For example, there was Uber Eats, there was, you know, food panda, all that got shut. So what was the competition that rivalry? Maybe like 10 years ago, there were a lot of companies like Zomato. All got killed, two remain now, Swiggy and Zomato. That's it. Okay, so it's got to be a third. No, right? So competitive rivalry is low here. This is also not a problem. Thread of substitutes. Can someone else come and you know, kill like Zomato business? The short answer is no. See, Zomato sets here. Okay. Here is where restaurants are. Right? Restaurants, restaurants, restaurant, quick commerce, whatever you call us or like retail stores. Okay. Now, they are a level up compared to these guys. Okay. For example, restaurants can be replaced, but Zomato, you will say that, okay, these all guys will come together and you know, kick Zomato out. So what are they waiting for? Are they waiting for like, you know, some uprising and then they will do it right? I mean, Zomato is already eating it to their margins. They have no option but to collaborate with Zomato to do science. Okay. So this is also not there. Baragaining power of customers. Now, when you buy on IPL, do you have any bargaining power? Can I have like, no, no, I used to buy it for me. I'll buy it for you. Tick her. No, so you can't do anything. Okay. So they will just price it. They will start like platform fee, convenience fee, whatever it is. Bargaining powers of suppliers, these restaurants, do they have any power? The short answer is no. So the point is that from a business point of view, it's highly unlikely that this business is going to go down, right? Han in three years. Oh, and DC how many years it has, Oh, and DCV not active. See, if anytime there is a government initiative, just laugh it off and do nothing on it. Okay. And I'll give you an example of Goa. Okay. And this is like I'm in Abhiya, Gya, Kino, what Ola, Uber, we will kill such idiotic steps. I cannot like even begin to fund. Okay. It's just idiotic, right? I mean, if you think from a capitalist point of view, think about it in this way. For example, I live in South Goa and I spend a considerable amount of time there every year. What is number one pain point in Goa that you don't get taxis? And if you get taxis, it's expensive and if it's not easy to book like Ola, Uber and all that stuff, what's the solution to that? Like genuine solution to that? The genuine solution to that is that hey, let businesses come, fight it out. For example, if Akshath wants to start his taxi fleet and provide good service, right, let him do it. Okay. And that's that. Okay. So, but what will happen is that there is like taxima fear. So you have just replaced Ola, Uber with an inefficient taxima fear, which hobnoms with politician. Of government, I'm the one, you know, networking app, whatever, like, you know, the cooperative of tax key app, we will launch Pan India level. Now, anyone who is building like Blue Smart, any
