==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text appears to be an informal, fragmented discussion (possibly from a lecture or Q&A session) about investing, stock markets, and portfolio strategies. The speaker covers topics like cash flow, flexibility in investment, specific stocks (e.g., H.U.L., Nifty, BSE), real estate vs. brand investments, intrinsic value skepticism, market consolidation, and sector-specific advice (e.g., defense, insurance, Chinese markets). They emphasize avoiding speculative bets, understanding portfolio construction, and focusing on fundamental analysis. The tone is conversational, with scattered advice and responses to audience questions.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. **Investment Philosophy**:  
   - Prefers owning brands (e.g., H.U.L.) over indirect plays like real estate companies.  
   - Advocates for flexibility in sourcing investment information.  

2. **Market Dynamics**:  
   - Nifty’s consolidation phases can create exit opportunities; losses may recover over time.  
   - Skeptical of "intrinsic value" as a concrete metric (varies by perspective).  

3. **Sector Opinions**:  
   - **Defense Sector**: Bearish due to domestic focus, corruption, and political risks.  
   - **Insurance/Healthcare**: Favorable (e.g., Max Healthcare, Narayana Hrudayalaya).  
   - **Chinese Stocks**: Speculative; hard to predict due to regulatory/political factors.  

4. **Platforms & Tools**:  
   - Recommends zero-brokerage platforms (e.g., Upstox, Grow) but stresses personal comfort.  
   - Criticizes technical indicators (e.g., RSI, MACD) for long-term investors.  

5. **Risk Management**:  
   - Avoids duplicating bets (e.g., no real estate stocks if owning physical property).  
   - Highlights the unpredictability of IPOs (e.g., OYO’s timing depends on market conditions).  

6. **Tax & Global Investing**:  
   - For NRIs in Europe investing in US markets, tax rates (e.g., 12.5% LTCG) matter more than platform choice.  
   - Warns against commercial real estate in India due to legal complexities.  

7. **General Advice**:  
   - Patience and fundamental analysis are key; avoid speculative trades.  
   - Portfolio allocation (e.g., growth stocks) depends on individual risk appetite.  

8. **Avoidances**:  
   - Political/policy-dependent stocks (e.g., defense).  
   - Overcomplicated industries (e.g., farmer tech, non-export sectors).  

9. **Upcoming Content**:  
   - Promises deeper dives into sector analysis, stock operations, and Excel-based tools in future sessions.  

10. **Miscellaneous**:  
    - Angel investing requires high capital and diversification (5–7 startups).  
    - HDFC group companies (e.g., HDFC AMC) tend to trade at premiums; short-term dips (10%) are inconsequential.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
kay okay good good good yeah cash flow balance it I'll teach in the evening right H.U.L is a good stuff no problem right investment knowledge any source of information that you will take for flexibility because of a lot of flexibility is really good because I'm a fan big fan of for flexibility yes so it's wonderful just ask sensible questions you'll get a lot of knowledge okay nifty b's so it's called why are you not able to find nifty I'm not able to find can you guys name the stock b's as an it okay so you guys have answered it okay what is a good platform do any zero brokerage platform like up stocks grow zero the anything that you're comfortable with right three real estate companies Anandraj blackstone punch shield reality Rostam G is a good idea to explore see guys I mean now honestly I will not duplicate my bets for example if I am data center is pretty much like real estate bet right so now if I already own hard real estate which I control then I would not own companies in that space right now I am not into products for example I can I do not have like you know a brand like in the sense key up is a brand h.u.l. is a brand so I would rather own brands okay so like real estate is not like so and then what's the point of like you know doing like an indirect play with Anandraj and all that so that's the thing but tomorrow it should be uploaded as well both the recordings intrinsic value is a MBA world okay so for example if you speak with Migginsy consultant's boss has those there are partners at Pigginsy and whatnot they'll tell you like really nice shiny woods okay so intrinsic value is one such nice shiny wood okay so that's what it is okay there is no intrinsic value right and it's it's up for debate if you ask three people to give intrinsic value of a stock we will all tell you three different numbers nifty is bought on 12 13% but what if it takes more than three four years to reach the exit point then is it just approximately three percent nice so it will not happen like that right I mean for example it's not as if like for example let me just draw it out right so this is nifty okay it has fallen by like 11 12% now let's assume a consolidating market right so consolidation means that it consolidates in a particular range let's consider this to be the range it falls more and it goes back up it falls more it goes back up it falls more it goes back up so these are all your exit points now this exit point might happen in one year okay so for example here you lost for example you invested 10 lakhs it becomes 8 lakhs here okay or like what are the 7 lakhs here right but from here to here this 7 lakh became how much it becomes 14 lakhs right something like this right so or whatever right so here you can exit right and this exit point you're hitting after one year right or one and a half year it cannot happen like I mean what you are assuming is straight line right I hope I was able to explain this thank you Abhishek okay buying shares of BSE and SES that's interesting I'm studying it I'll release a note this week itself right defense I'm not bullish man actually what I get defense defense make you know like we are not exporting exporting right I mean we are just internally consuming so so there is like no competitive advantage here right I mean if you are exporting to like France exporting to like some other countries it would have kind of made sense but we are just domestically consuming Air Force order it's a deeply corrupt industry right I mean you require like contacts to sell so there is no way to analyze any company and if you buy a company based on the assumption gain political relationships are they will be able to sell more what if the government change what if you know some complicated guy creates problem for them so this becomes like a political stock so don't do it okay regular to direct you just sell your regular okay and move to direct okay so that's the simplest thing I can say okay for X trading is illegal in India so you can't do it okay can you apply what we learn on the US market yes you can HDFC noama stocks HDFC AMC I've sold noama I'm holding right are those still at buy levels you'll understand right you need to go through fundamental analysis class which I will do next so you'll understand more okay screener and all I'll teach you any correlation of moving index relevant as well in the parabolic change no so MSED RSI use Karna is not sensible for investors if you are a technical trader it kind of makes sense but do using like MSED is good from an investing point of view okay for trading point of view I'll not recommend right Kiran no problem I will sort this out for you right just drop me like a linden okay will you teach how to do business analysis of entire sector and how we can use it along the yes I'll do that China stock market see what how I see it is pointless okay so it's speculative it's breaking out right now right so I'm just putting a little bit of money and I'm done right but it's very hard to do prognosis on these things it really depends if China wants to focus on growing their stock market if they focus it will become like US stock market which is like an asymmetric bet right okay right is it worth moving to Dubai Europe when earning like 25 lakhs per annum in a metro like India but how much will you earn in Dubai that's a more sensible question to ask right then you can compare your life otherwise if you just say that 25 lakhs in metro I'm earning and you say that I can only like let's say 25,000 dirams monthly salary in Dubai now which is better then I can give you a comparison right what percentage of investable money do you suggest to invest in if t50 this is portfolio construction question so hopefully this will get cleared with time right so please go class by class okay so today we learned like how stock market operates evening session we learn how individual stocks operate and all that right so like have a little bit of patience right it will get cleared okay can you share that excel see I'll share that right I'll do this by like Monday Tuesday consolidation period has a rectangular formation this I'll teach yeah you were saying that 67% growth stocks that means they're meaning 30 no I'm not saying that 60 70% should be growth stocks that's my strategy okay you might very well be happy with 30% growth stocks okay you pick that's your call right it really boils down to the dipo person you are if you're hyper greedy you might want to have like 100% growth okay how do you con great that's all the wind right but that is your call okay thank you saiba saiba really appreciate when do you think oyo will IPO it will IPO very high probability right now when depends on what the market circumstances are right so we can't estimate it right because a lot depends on the market companies typically IPO when stock market starts running right because they know that they can get like higher valuation right if volumes for fundamentally how do you deal with it in any indicators like volume it's TV it fell 10% should I hold or sell anything HDB financial you should not sell it's a good company and because it's a HDFC bank company it will always trade at a premium all HDFC companies trade at a premium right so you should not do anything just stay put right and 10% fall is not that bigger deal because entire market itself has fallen by 15 20% small gaps are fallen by 25 30% right I will not recommend any stocks guys but I'll take enough examples and you will have enough idea to build your portfolio right at the end of the course coal India P right with an ROC of 63 okay it doesn't matter okay for example some stocks historically trade low right you have to understand what type of a stock it is so you'll get more clarity right I mean as we progress through the course insurance industry is a very good industry okay I'll start using some examples in the evening class right so that will give you more clarity insurance industry coal industry all that right okay Nasdaq Dima or buying via wasted is better if you're doing it via India then invested is good yeah worry renewable tech I don't buy complicated chess okay so is there a way to invest in US market for NRIs resident in Europe LTCG and paid access in India okay and how much tax are you paying in India 40% I don't like so like if you're a tax resident I don't know like Europe India rule right but I think you should be paying like LTCG as 12.5 you know I'll show if that's the case that even if you're booking profits in Europe through any app for example if you're using ETO row right to invest in the US markets you should be paying 12.5 not 40 but not short correct or that's correct that you should if you have one carotid to invest invest like 70 75 quickly right and then wait with 30% hedge okay bulk by versus maximum by but see the instrument in which you are investing is 50 50 you're not taking speculative gambals right like you know individual stocks okay how can I invest in Chinese market you can do it via wasted right hands-on business fine both are fine okay investing in commercial are you don't do it okay in India laws are very complicated it's very difficult to wicked a commercial real estate the only loss making real estate I own is a commercial real estate okay so out of like you know 10 11 properties that I would know right so the only loss making real estate is my commercial industry okay what are your thoughts on it and farmer it and bearish yeah farmer is good I don't know enough it's complicated for me to understand okay if I would rather buy like healthcare stocks because that's much better for me right I mean if you just simply buy max up all low Narayan hit it down there right all that stuff that's better okay video think we can make better returns angel investing unlisted versus IPOC if you're doing angel investing then you need to at least be like a 5CR person right and invest across like 5 7 startups because if you
