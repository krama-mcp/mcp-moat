==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a fragmented discussion covering various investment topics, primarily focused on the Indian stock market, real estate, cryptocurrencies, tax implications for NRIs, and portfolio strategies. The speaker shares personal investment preferences (e.g., bullish on Indian stocks based on valuation, avoiding Bitcoin investing in India due to high taxes) and addresses audience questions on topics like fractional investing, gold/silver allocation, NPS (National Pension System) returns, and tax residency (e.g., UAE options). Key themes include tax optimization, diversification, and caution against relying on stock markets for regular income.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Indian Stock Market:** The speaker is 95% invested and bullish on a valuation basis, aiming for 15–20% profits.  
- **Cryptocurrencies:** Avoids Bitcoin investing in India due to high taxes; prefers vested ETFs for exposure.  
- **Real Estate:** Recommends holding properties via corporate entities in India for lower tax rates (corporate tax ~25% vs. income tax ~42%).  
- **Tax Residency:** Explains UAE tax residency options (business, job, freelancer visa) and benefits like zero capital gains tax in Singapore/UAE.  
- **NPS (National Pension System):** Skeptical of claimed 12–14% returns; emphasizes lack of capital rotation flexibility compared to Nifty.  
- **Portfolio Design:** Advocates equities for growth (not regular income), real estate in high-inflation economies, and SWP (Systematic Withdrawal Plans) cautiously.  
- **NRI Investments:** Tailored based on country of residence (e.g., US investments for Singapore residents; Indian real estate for NRIs).  
- **Gold/Silver:** Allocation to be addressed separately in portfolio design.  
- **Goa Real Estate:** Positive outlook unless prices are inflated.  
- **Tax Efficiency:** Corporate structures for real estate, equities for tax efficiency in India.  
- **Market Realism:** Warns against expecting consistent returns (e.g., ITC’s 10-year sideways movement).  

**Additional Notes:**  
- Emphasizes practical challenges (e.g., SWP execution, market volatility).  
- Recommends following case studies (e.g., speaker’s NRI investments in India/Dubai).  
- Advises against over-reliance on stock markets for income; favors cash-flow assets for stability.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
enough I'll explain this case study is it right time to buy stocks in Indian stock shock market yes okay so I'm 95% invested I am bullish right am I bullish on a secular basis no I am bullish on valuation basis keep up balating and you should be able to book like 15 20% profits yeah what is your take on stake for investment is no I don't do it why that yeah so Bitcoin investing no I'll not cover on stock this is stock investing right right so fractional investing yeah fractional investing is possible in BTC no so I only by Bitcoin and cryptos right advantages of holding real estate through real estate company because it becomes a corporate entity in India and corporate tax and India is low right so the highest income tax in India is like what 40% 42% with the highest corporate effective taxes like what 25% right so how much of my money should go into gold or silver as an investment how much of my money we will have a separate portfolio design class so we'll cover it there gift city aif for NRIs okay okay okay see ideally if you are in Singapore now Singapore capital gains is 0 okay dividend distribution tax I'll have double check how much it is but honestly like there is no major advantage you'll get by coming to gift city can you be a UAE resident for tax purpose and maintain yes you cannot become a UAE tax you can become a UAE citizen also like on exceptional basis but generally it is not done tax residency means in which country you are paying tax okay citizenship means that which country you are a citizen of so most of the Indians working in UAE are citizens of India and they are picked being taxis in Dubai or UAE okay okay guys I'll try to like do some portfolio reviews in front of entire class okay so subsequently okay important to have a second house in tier 1 tier 1 tier 3 township in primary source in number 1 or in our second house in tier 2 city or tier 1 you know that really depends on what you want right and maybe we'll talk if the end of the course is not clear let me know right but hopefully it will give you like so give me some time now this should get clearer with time should I continue sing up if you are in Singapore you should invest more in US because capital gains is not there if you are investing in Singapore capital gains will be there like very similar to how it is for UAE tax resident in India okay okay where should NRIs invest currently depends on which countries NRI are you okay so like that's how do we tax resident of UA there is a video that I've done right so you can check about that that I've explained like 15-20 minutes okay if I have an NRI account in India does it make sense to invest in US for closing the account it would not matter no it's so like I don't think it will matter right will you also cover how can we save taxes in India with living in India via different types of investments see generally you should invest in in equities equities and most tax efficient in India and real estate may if you're owning multiple real estate then form a maintenance company on it right real estate maintenance company register it as a corporate entity and manage it via that because then you can do various expenses via that right so it lowers your bottom line and corporate taxes are low which mutual fund yes so mutual fund will have and invest SWP mutual fund good we are buying you cannot create a regular income from stock market stock market is for growth not for regular income and this is something that I covered in the start of the class rent return should you pay capital gains tax or rent returns you have to pay I don't think you can not pay that okay thank you but right thank you is Goa still a better place to invest in yes Goa is a wonderful place right I mean unless you are mine over high to properties at north work right so yeah individual HNI any perspective on HNI account what is the meaning of HNI account I don't understand okay landy money moved Dubai India first would you be good idea so what are the tax implications you have to sit and plan properly so as an NRI Priyanka so just drop me like a link then I'll connect you with right guys on this guessing Australia is high tax and very high inflation so then owning a property might make sense right see whatever high inflation economies are there you should own properties or at least one property investment in India as NRI yeah yeah so that I'll cover it's literally I'm a case study like I'm investing in India as NRI I have some family money which I would like to move to Dubai from this I've answered more do you do the current condition what are your thoughts on this is a part of US portfolio and the community you know okay Bharati see I mean it kind of makes sense to do both right in India and US for you right I'm doing the same so just keep following whatever I'm doing right not clear on investing in Bitcoin from India see buying Bitcoin via vested ETF is much better compared compared to because that becomes like a stock it's not Bitcoin investing so your taxes are but if you buy Bitcoin in India then the taxes are very high right no no I'll not review portfolio I'll just pick some parts of it and teach it right so that's how I'll do it I'm not not taking any money or extra thing I cannot legally do it okay in all fund houses since inception of a long time investing I can save lakhs on my returns NPS returns are 12 in fund houses I don't know and I'll just double check okay shall I invest in India or US in China so Norway I'm assuming you will have a barely high capital gains tax it doesn't matter you can invest anywhere yeah from lakhs to ten crore how you have improved your portfolio okay so this I'll try to answer like subsequently okay so yeah okay that Kumar and Paul yes he's going to yes sorry I might have already covered but still asking the question how do you become a tax resident of UAE how do you become a tax resident three options one is that you set up a business number two is you find a job number three is that you become a freelancer right so these are three options right you get so for example you can become a freelancer right I mean there is a freelancer visa in UAE you take that license right not hypercomplicated get it to get it then you have a a renewal cost of that right so it will be three four lakh rupees every two years right then you live in UAE for six months right yeah and then you get your TRC tax residency certificate okay or you find a job so that the company issues a visa or you set up a business right yeah oh sorry yeah Paul Haroon hi actually the good afternoon am I audible now yeah I have gone through this complete video thanks for this session and I completely agree that we can't do the capital rotation for long term in NPS okay but my as per my study we are having 12 to 14 percentage of returns over a long term in all the pension fund houses what I have learned and that also non-taxable so we can save tax in a lakhs if you are continuing for up to 30 years say for example my age is 30 years up to 60 years if I do NPS means I can get the non-taxable income though it is from the government I quite doubt about that in future also they may give some kind of they will put it is not sure yeah so what is your opinion about this because I can get a non-taxable returns if I do SIP in 50 50 comparatively so it is better no so see I mean the assumption is that you will make like 12 14 percent returns I don't know if that is actually true the NPS thing that you are telling me because NPS even the money is invested in the market instrument and then there's a pension fund managing it so pension fund will never take like that level of risk I don't know how they are making 12 14 percent returns mathematically it doesn't make much sense but let's assume that you're correct like that NPS actually gives 12 14 percent returns there's no guarantee that that will continue to happen that's one second is that you don't get the option of capital rotation the way you will get it on nifty so on a 30 year basis right if you are rotating capital only once on nifty I'd add an opportune time then also you are making much higher returns and one more thing our mr. Saurav Mukherjeev's also very supportive for this NPS he's also personally doing in all his videos he's saying and then it kind of gives me more bullishness that if Saurav Mukherjeev's bullish on something I'm bearing on that right so that's what I'll say thank you so much and one more question regarding the SWP for SWP we have in this session itself we have discussed 12 percentage as a inflation and the 16 percentage is the return that four percentage withdrawal will be for all the every year so if the market doesn't give any return for the consecutively for two years or three years certainly after the third year after the second year it may rise up okay so it will compensate the returns right yes it will therefore I'm saying that you know SWP plans on great in theory but it is you know practically it's very difficult to execute if you want to withdraw see it really depends on the size of your portfolio if you're like at like three four CR plus range eventually at the age 16 now and you have three four CR then you have to like you know invest in like cash flow assets which kind of helps you meet your daily expenses right so and you can all depend on the market for that stock market is great for growing your wealth stock market is not a place where you get like regular returns from your investment because for example if we buy like let's say private banks ETF now it might very well go two year more sideways who knows right so for example ITC was a decent stock it went sideways for 10 years okay so yeah I mean I say you cannot for the safer side only we are having this four percentage withdrawal every year means if it is giving eight percentage as or also it will be very good right no for example in the last one year if you would have done SIP on your mutual fund a
