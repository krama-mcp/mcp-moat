SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker reflects on their investing journey, emphasizing the importance of diversification beyond Indian markets for long-term stability. They admit to past mistakes, such as insufficient international diversification and poor tax efficiency, and now advocate for systems to invest globally. They discuss specific stocks (e.g., Rajesh Exports, HDFC Bank), sectors (EV, gold), and tools (Bitcoin ETFs, US stocks via platforms like Vested). Additionally, they share insights on mistakes, market trends, and practical tips for investing, including tax considerations and capital rotation. The speaker also highlights the value of tools like Perplexity for research and stresses learning from errors while maintaining a disciplined approach.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Diversification is critical:** Avoid over-concentration in Indian markets; aim for at least 30% international exposure for long-term stability.  
- **Learn from mistakes:** The speaker regrets not diversifying earlier and failing to build systems for global investments, leading to tax inefficiency.  
- **Sector-specific insights:**  
  - EV sector (e.g., Tata, Bajaj) and Bitcoin ETFs are viable but require caution.  
  - Gold is overbought; limit exposure to diversification purposes only.  
- **Practical tools:** Platforms like Vested (for US stocks) and Perplexity (for research) are recommended for efficient investing.  
- **Tax and jurisdiction matter:** Capital gains vary by location (e.g., Singapore offers 0% tax for residents); align investments with tax efficiency.  
- **Discipline and tracking:** Rotate capital strategically, monitor sectors like insurance/healthcare, and use frameworks (e.g., 17 parameters) to evaluate stocks.  
- **Market humility:** Valuations (e.g., NSE IPO) are unpredictable; focus on long-term indicators rather than timing the market.  
- **Education mindset:** Share knowledge, learn from errors (e.g., momentum trading misses), and prioritize system-building over ad-hoc decisions.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 I continue see Indian markets are fairly valued now somewhat fairly valued so you can pick not an issue right but having said this long term wise you have to be sensible right at least have 30% diversification out of India okay unfortunately I learned this if I have to talk about one primary mistake that I made in my investing journey in the last five years this was it right so that I did not diversify internationally earlier okay why because I never wanted to move outside India okay but after a point it got like you know crazy right so I had to right which meant that you know I never built any system of moving outside India and which meant that inadvertently I had to invest everything that I had in India yeah so it was not a very smart strategy which was very tax inefficient right and now I'm like realizing that it's just not yeah it's just not worth it okay so yeah swing trading I'm already teaching you along the way so I've taught you some in the last week right more I'll teach okay thank you and any example of when we went wrong with socks section what could be the reason a lot of times right so for example just say Rajesh export right so again I did not know that the company would do fraud HDFC bank we bought in little bit early right that was to right but then make a mistake with HDFC no I mean I think it has already given a decent run up now right that was to what else uh momentum in trading I did not do like a couple of years back when I should have done right so that's another so you always make mistakes that's not the point right in the EV announcement would it be good to take positions in TBS see TBS is good right I think two dealers is going to do well they are already corrected quite a lot hero motorclaw of TBS, Bajaj or to all three of fine you can hunt okay best ETF to buy Bitcoin okay I'll check this because I do not buy ETFs right but let me check uh is there any platform which we can buy US stocks tomorrow I'll tell right so vested you can use I'm an angel investor invested so I'll give you like a link if you guys want you'll get more discounts otherwise the FX charges are more right so that's a problem that you will typically face right I mean if you just simply open an account with vested or I&D money then every time you're converting your I&R into US dollar that's where you'll lose a lot of commissions at least that problem I'll help you solve to a very large extent okay gray scale between available on vested huh I think they are right I'm not shanked vested as refunded extra money to my international bank is now asking me for purpose code etc then I wait to redeem money from vested there is no complication it's very easy to redeem money from vested because vested has a partnership with HDFC one but every time you move money in and out of India you have to give procedural disclosures right there is nothing that you know we can do about it right and if you do it with any other party also this is the same process then you'll have to go okay but the good news is that once you know what purpose code to put how to fill that form it's a you know let's get a five minute job okay nsc ipodilate for two years what's your take for unlisted share buyer see nsc is still you have to look at assets like nsc on a large scale on a large on a large time frame basis so if you're looking at it at a 10 year basis then nsc is a very solid stock okay it is literally like how to put it for example crypto is an indicator of sorry Bitcoin is an indicator of crypto space nsc is an indicator of India stock market okay so it's not even like yeah that's how I'll put it okay so as the stock adoption goes up nsc will benefit automatically right and it's as stable as it gets foreign investors can't buy too much of nsc the only issue with nsc is buying at the right price now no one knows so therefore buy like 50% and unlisted 50% after it gets listed and if it goes through a correction because what has happened is that bsc has given like you know almost 10x run up now people know this so the moment nsc ipod comes in people are going to jump okay and they are going to pump it up right anything your views on mana Puram has been see gold I'm not taking too much bets now it's extremely bullish so I'm not comfortable taking too much bets on gold because you're buying absolute positive sentiments on gold right now okay so does it make sense to over-invest in gold absolutely not if you're just doing it for diversification it's fine okay yes I'll share the excel spreadsheet I myself don't teach why I'm not so what will I teach you I tell like stories and all right so I think you just revive the class okay buying index was just I've explained can you buy Bitcoin ETF in India yes you can so for example on West did you can buy Bitcoin ETF will lose to Mahindra and Maruti will lose to international brands I think so okay is buying us talks from Singapore advantageous the capital gains in Singapore is zero if you're a tax resident of Singapore technically you should be paying 0% tax as far as I know and how should we buy from here so you have e2ro something like this so you can buy that or your bank might open an at-rating account for you so you can do that as well so any Singaporean bank will open it okay what do you listen to geography to understand the different views what do you listen I actually talk to a lot of people yes so like my primary knowledge base is like talking to people right I myself invest my money so I have to keep tracking it I have to keep on like looking at charts graphs all that right so on on day and day out basis so that's primary source of information and the best information source right now is perplexity learn how to use it okay so that's the even if you're not using any other single website okay just download perplexity and use it it's great okay yes you can is there an index for NSC private bank yes so it's called private bank ETF I don't know which company has launched it just search pvt bank ETF you will get it on your zero nagu okay thank you but conch and want to know the grace scale okay I'll get back on like bitcoin ETF which one you can buy because I'm no I do not buy it from an ETF basis so I don't have it right in the back of my mind should I let that be completely ah vintika says that I'm on like one-way eight percent profit and most companies are good fundamentally see you should always rotate capital you might have bought it in a great market right which was at twenty twelve thousand five hundred you might have caught some because you honestly like one twenty is not that great to be honest if you're looking at if you put some money in a fall because the market itself corrected by fifty percent right so if you bought the dip people are sitting on like two hundred two twenty five two fifty plus basis also right so you should learn how to rotate capital that I will always advocate okay which platforms to buy us stock script or buy an ii ii b care you can buy you can that's good okay cyclical stocks I'll talk tomorrow silver ETF I'll talk silver say I don't buy silver okay I won't nse ipo pricing be interested I want you to kiss like me is in a new valuations no one can say anything about valuation of nse I'm being upfront with you it's very hard to value company right what I know for sure is that it's unlikely to come at a discount right so for example if you buy unlisted ipo jbb you will make a new high okay so that's given okay now then depending on the market circumstances the market remains bullish that it will continue to do well okay if it the market becomes bearish then of course it will correct right and then it will go through a pie price discovery me that I haven't checked but overall it should be okay but I'll double check okay thirty eight on five crore nifty I'm not right for the problem I just want to try to fall on the bottom and then the price and what I priced around you might not have bought it 15 percent down because that's when I had said that I'm buying nifty now then it went back went up by like six percent so if you just calculate that the profit should be much higher okay companies like power grid I don't know I bet India seems okay it's it's a good company overall akshat for your tax and UAE is zero then why did you do tax laws harvesting because for my India investments which are already there right I still have to pay LTCG and STCG okay even as an LRI so I have to tax laws harvest there okay but if I'm investing in the US stocks as a UAE tax resident then the taxes are zero so I don't need to do any tax laws harvesting in the US okay wow how much of a way able total this I'll ask answer tomorrow right okay I didn't understand center your question it will be if you please get it you get it problem okay I tried to no I don't I don't get it so for example if you check my post so when I made that post at that point in time and in fact I have put the picture also that it was at minus 16 percent now if if I is now the when I'm exited that trade I made like around six percent returns all right so six seven percent returns right on that so therefore that 38 lakh profit around that was a point yeah Parma I already explained I don't understand Parma okay so it's easier to understand insurance and healthcare okay so I'm buying those because it serves one in the same purpose okay the Parma growth will not happen without growth in insurance and healthcare stocks or hospital stocks right yeah Kavita Paul hey hi Akshad thank you for taking this time and doing this course right I mean thank God you're a passionate educator so I'll first get to learn from you thank you for that my quick question is around these 17 parameters and the multiple stocks that we track and each stock is probably in you know on a different journey maybe ROC is not on point maybe PE is not on point what's your best practice and keeping track of of of these stocks that's question number one oh yeah and the seco
