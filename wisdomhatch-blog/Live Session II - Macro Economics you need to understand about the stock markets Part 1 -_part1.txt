SUMMARY:
The session is a continuation of a macroeconomics discussion focused on stock markets and asset classes. The instructor recaps previous points about asset diversification, liquidity's impact on asset prices, and the importance of choosing assets aligned with financial goals (e.g., retirement planning). The discussion shifts to criticizing structurally weak assets like EPF (Employee Provident Fund) due to low liquidity and growth compared to alternatives like NIFTY 50. The instructor emphasizes the evolving nature of investing rules (e.g., taxation changes) and the need for objective analysis. A key debate arises about why certain markets (e.g., UAE, Japan, China) underperform, linking it to government control and strategic priorities (e.g., inflation management, foreign ownership limits). The session underscores the importance of understanding macroeconomic factors and adapting investment strategies accordingly.  

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Asset Diversification Matters**: Different assets (stocks, gold, real estate) serve unique purposes and should align with financial goals (e.g., regular income vs. growth).  
- **Liquidity Drives Asset Prices**: Increased money supply (e.g., post-2008) inflates prices of hard and soft assets, emphasizing macro trends.  
- **Critique of Traditional Assets**: EPF/NPS may underperform due to low liquidity and growth; evolving rules (e.g., taxation) necessitate flexibility.  
- **Government Influence on Markets**: Underperformance in UAE/Japan/China stock markets reflects deliberate policy (e.g., inflation control, strategic ownership limits).  
- **Ownership and Control**: Foreign investment caps (e.g., HDFC Bank’s 49% FI ownership) highlight geopolitical risks in equity markets.  
- **Adaptability in Investing**: Historical performance doesn’t guarantee future returns; investors must stay educated and objective.  
- **Strategic Resources**: Some sectors (e.g., Singapore’s telecom) remain state-controlled to prevent foreign interference, affecting market dynamics.

==================================================

 Hi everyone, I hope you can see me. I'm just a very quick thumbs up if you can. Okay, awesome. All right, we'll just wait for like a few seconds and then we will start. Meanwhile, what I can do is I'll just quickly recap like in a couple of minutes. What we had studied in the morning session and then we will continue, right? So the first key thing that we studied in the morning session was around asset diversification, right? So there are different assets which are plotted on a risk reward curve like this, right? And you accordingly have to construct a portfolio. Second key point was that every asset that you add, for example, stocks are very different from gold. Gold is very different from real estate. Okay, collectively they should solve some problem for you. Okay. For example, if the goal is retirement planning and if you say that, my parents are like old and they require like regular income, then regular income can't be created from stocks. That's not the objective of the stock market. Regular income can be created with a very high degree of certainty from real estate. Right, this was number two. Then we started the macroeconomic section where we studied something about liquidity, right? And which simply meant that if we increase the liquidity or money flow in the economy, it leads to something called as asset price appreciation. And from the year 2008 to 2022, right? Additional 23 trillion dollars of liquidity has been created in the world, due to which the prices of real estate, the prices of stocks, the prices of gold, etc has gone up. We can plot the assets on hard assets, right? Versus soft assets, right? And stocks will fall somewhere here, right? It will some fall somewhere here. In case you missed all these points, it's not a big deal. We'll be uploading the recordings, right? By tomorrow. So you can watch it in detail and that will give you more clarity. Now, I would like to start that class from here by deepening this grid. So I'll keep using this grid in the future as well, right? For the future classes. And one key point to understand here is that see, there are certain asset class which do not solve any purpose in the current world. Okay, so like I mean, honestly, like they're the structurally or in simpler language. They are structurally bad as per today. Now you'll get very pissed off with me that how can I say like, you know, PF, EPS, EPS are bad. Okay. How dare I say that, right? So see, guys, one simple rule of investing is that you need to evolve, right? One simple rule of career is that you need to evolve. One simple rule of life is that you need to evolve. If you forever assume that whatever happened in the last 20 years, it will continue to happen in the next 20 years. It's a stupidity, right? I mean, it would not happen. So it's very important for us to be objective in our analysis. We are not here to satisfy our ego. We are not here to win any war. It's just money. We are investing money to grow our money, right? So that's the objective. And if we can do that at a sensible way, that's the objective. We are not here to win like any debates. Okay. So if structurally speaking, something looks bad, it's bad. Right? So for example, you know, the reason why I said PF, EPF, EPF are bad is because you're locking your money on a long term basis. Right? So for example, here, you're locking your money. Liquidity is very low, right? Growth is not as much compared to something like, let's say, FTP 50, right? So an FTP 50 will typically grow at 12, 13%. And a safe NPS, for example, will grow between 9 to 12%. So the correct comparison, there is 9%. Okay. The taxation rules around asset classes keeps on evolving, right? For example, in 2018, there was no LTCG on equities, right? Now there is 12.5, right, which is a substantial increase on LTCG. Now I cannot comment, try to mean whether equities will be a great asset class after 15, 20 years, all that stuff. Okay. So if I have to give you the first key takeaway of today's class or like this session, it's very simple. That's he has investors. Our first job is to educate ourselves about different asset classes. Okay. Why? Because the rules of investing keeps on changing. You might feel that you know what real estate is not great right now or real estate is not good right now and all that stuff. But it might be one of the best assets, right? In five years time, we cannot comment, right? Similarly, you might feel that you know what equities, what's a point because real estate always gives great returns. Then again, the point becomes that you don't know what the taxation around it would be, which brings me to question number one, right? And a good thought exercise. If you live in UAE, right? Why is it that people in UAE get very excited about real estate, but they invest no money in UAE based equities? Any logic or like I mean anyone wants to debate this fact. I mean people who are not from UAE would not know this. That almost 10 investors that you speak with nine of them would be exclusively investing their money in real estate. There is no other asset class that they go to. Why is that? Trust in government equity market not that great in UAE. Okay, very good question. So why is equity market not that great in UAE? What's the reason? Low returns. Okay, why is the returns low? Government support needed someone rightly pointed out the answer that government support is needed, right? So which brings us to the question that she was. I mean, for example, like if you go around like one one and a half years ago, right? There was this entire debate that you know what Indian economy is great because our stock market is great. By that logic, like people in Japan should be dying of hunger, right? That because if I show you like you know Japanese stock market, right? If you go and simply check Japanese. Right. Let's see. Okay, so here is Japanese stock market, right? So if you would have invested $100 in Japan in 1990, it would have been $100 still long. Okay, so zero percent returns. Okay, so by that logic, everyone should be dying of hunger in like Japan because Japanese stock market does not grow. So by according to our politicians logic, even Japan is like a food do economy, right? So what's happening in Japan? And how many of you have been to Japan and if you've gone to Japan, do you feel that it like it's a hunger? It's a poor people's nation or something like that? Yes, so a profile lives there, right? So do you think that you know Japan is a lower run economy compared to India or something like so? No, so in Japan, they have a unique problem, right? So Japan, what is happening is that they are majority of the population or not majority, but their average population age is very high. They worry about inflation because for example, if you're 60 and majority of people living in India, for example, are 60 65. Most likely they will not be working or they would not be in the workforce. They have to survive on their retirement fund, whatever they have created. Now if Japan inherently is a high inflation economy, for example, where the cost of living keeps going up by 5, 6%, 7%, what would that do to your retirement plan for a 60, 65 years, 70 year old person? It will be a huge problem, right? Because you don't know like whether you will be able to survive, right? I mean, now on top of that, you're making people gamble on there, like you know, stock market and whatever, right? So the point is that Japan stock market does not give returns because Japanese government does not want it to give returns. UAE stock market does not give returns because UAE stock market or UAE government does not want it to give returns. UAE real estate gives returns because UAE government wants to give it give give returns. Now you'll say that, okay, that's interesting. Why would you not want your stock market to give return? What's the logical sense behind that? On the flip side, why do you think Chinese stock market does not give returns? Same story like Japan, right? Any take or sign anyone wants to speak and explain. Because there is a downside to your stock market, which is a very interesting conversation, right? And which has to do with the concept of strategic control, okay? So for example, if I show you HDFC bank, okay? So here you go, right? How you go on here, right? You type HDFC bank, right? And HDFC bank, you will consider it to be an Indian bank, okay? Here you go on investor's tab. What you will see is FIs for an institutional investors own 49% of your HDFC bank, okay? So is it technically like an Indian bank? Maybe like because 51% are these, right? But in public, for example, let's say Akshad is public. Now if I was a regular, let's say I'm a Chinese citizen, okay? And I own 1% of HDFC bank. Now FIs plus Akshad were foreign national can typically only 51% of HDFC bank, okay? I'll say Singapore could hear it even more difference does it make? Well, I can change, then we can change the board. We can change a lot of things. We can change the regulation, right? Exectra, etc. Okay? Another very interesting exercise. How many of you live in Singapore? You wait and talk about strategic resources? Example, in Singapore, there is a company called a Singed by the company. There is a company called a Singed tell, right? Which is a government owned entity, right? It's owned by Tamasek, which is the investment arm of the Singapore government, okay? 100% of ownership and telecom is by the Singaporean government, okay? There is no foreign intervention there. If you go to UAE, telecom is owned by Etisala and you both are owned by the shake there, okay? They don't allow you to own that, okay? Or no foreign intervention whatsoever, right? The point being that once you open up your stock
