SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses a strategy for investing in unlisted stocks (pre-IPO), focusing on three key criteria: strong brand/business, long-term sustainability (4-5 years), and reasonable valuation. The speaker emphasizes avoiding post-IPO purchases due to price volatility and speculative behavior during the IPO phase. Examples like Ola Electric, Oyo, Swiggy, and Paytm illustrate the risks and opportunities in unlisted markets. The strategy involves building partial positions pre-IPO and waiting for price discovery post-listing. The speaker also highlights monopoly stocks like NSC as safer long-term bets but warns against government-backed IPOs (e.g., LIC) due to speculation. The overall approach prioritizes patience, valuation, and brand strength.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Investment Criteria for Unlisted Stocks:** Focus on strong brands, sustainable business models (4-5 years), and fair valuations.  
- **Avoid Post-IPO Purchases:** IPOs involve price discovery and speculation; buying pre-IPO at lower valuations is preferred.  
- **Position Sizing:** Build 50% of positions pre-IPO and adjust post-listing based on price discovery.  
- **Examples of Success/Failure:** Oyo (undervalued post-bubble), Swiggy (post-IPO volatility), and Paytm (market timing risks) serve as case studies.  
- **Monopoly Stocks Advantage:** Companies like NSC (monopoly) are considered safer long-term holds due to stable demand.  
- **Lock-in Periods:** Early investors and founders face a 6-month lock-in post-IPO, aligning interests with long-term performance.  
- **Market Timing Risks:** Bull/bear markets during IPO significantly impact short-term performance (e.g., Paytmâ€™s post-IPO decline).  
- **Government IPOs Caution:** Stocks like LIC attract speculative frenzy but may underperform due to structural inefficiencies.  
- **Patience is Key:** Hold unlisted stocks for 5+ years to realize multi-bagger returns, avoiding short-term trading.  
- **Backend Complexity:** Investment bankers and founders collaborate to ensure IPO success, creating indirect incentives for stability.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
at we need to do on unlisted stocks is that Ola electric. So was like another company altogether. Right. I mean, what the whole again. Rajak Pripich is Alkria. Right. So just leave it. Right. So the point is that here we do not buy every type of company that is out there. We buy companies where you understand that a lot of interest will come A where the brand value is there. Right. Some kind. Okay. And second key point is that the business will sustain for four five years. Right. That's second Creek area. And third is that you buy at a decent valuation. Three things. Okay. One brand should be strong. Slash business should be strong. Those 1718 point checklist if you just go through. Second is that the business will be able to survive for four five years because if you buy even post IPO. Right. For example, if you bought pay TM post IPO. But I did not buy it by the way. So I do not buy companies post IPO. Right. I mean, this IPO is a price discovery game. Okay. So Mama Artha De Clow and all that stuff. Same stuff has happened. Okay. So for example, people will buy it like this. This is dumping of IPO. Right. Now it will go through a price correction. Right. And price discovery. And after three four years, five years, then again, like, you know, this price will hit. Okay. So you either buy if you are really interested in buying like, you know, NSDL or sorry, NSC. Or if you're really interested in buying OO, then again, something similar might happen with them. Okay. Then IPO, for example, on the listed pay, NSC is let's say hypothetically 1600 rupees. Okay. Now IPO might open at 3600. Okay. This is IPO. People will look at BSC. People will say, yeah, these are BSC or went 11X. Here at least five X will be there. Okay. Where do people start tracking prices? People start tracking price post IPO. Okay. So just in a, I'll just open up BSC again. So here is BSC. Okay. So BSC's price tracking, where will it start? It will start tracking from 335. They will not start tracking from un-illisted space prices. Everyone is understanding this because there is no price history around it. Okay. So here, what will people see? Yeah. They go BSC. That's a buggy. Right. So how will NSC go? NSC also similar company like BSC. So it will also grow like this only. Okay. So let's assume that the IPO is getting, you know, right now un-illisted, it's getting sold at like whatever 1600 rupees. Even if it gets listed at 3500 rupees, people will run to buy this. Why? Because NSC is a monopoly stock. Okay. Oyo, what are you buying? Oyo, you are buying undervaluation. For example, when I bought Oyo in the un-listed space, I bought it at a $4 billion valuation. So the company was valued at $4 billion. Now, why am I saying that this is undervalued? The reason is very simple because at one point in time, Oyo was valued at $11 billion in the private space. Then almost 60, 70% of its value got eroded. Why? Because that was the startup bubble. Okay. And Oyo survived that startup bubble. So three things that we need to take a look at in un-listed space. Number one, brand. Okay. That is there a some kind of brand. Okay. Number two, will the business survive for at least five years? In number three, is the valuation somewhat fair. Now, you have to do like a relative computation here because you'll not get the data to do this, right? You cannot track like technicals and all that stuff here. So here you have to do like a really broad math, right? Ki brand unishie. NSC is a very strong brand. Will it survive? 100% it will survive. 100-tony-volts-at-ten, 99.99% it will survive for the next five years. Valuation does it seem fair? We don't know, right? So therefore what I am doing is that I will build 50% of my position pre-IPU because I don't know at what price it will IPO. And 50% I will then see what to do once IPO has happened and price discovery has happened. Okay. So this is the technique that I'm buying in un-listed space for NSC. What about Oyo? So Oyo, I have already built like 100% of positions that I wanted to build because there I have a clear valuation because Oyo had fallen in valuation. And now I'm buying it here. So after IPO, the only goal is to pump up the price. Okay. So look at that. Yeah, I mean how it goes. Okay. Now in the un-listed space, the, for example, Swiggy story. Now Swiggy unlisted that I bought it for was around 360 rupees. Okay. It IPOed at 460, 470 and then it went to 600 and now it has fallen to 350. Okay. So right now it is going through a price discovery. But the point is that the floor price has been set and the market situation in which the IPO comes determines its fate. Okay. What does that mean? For example, if you are on a bull market and NSC IPO is in a bull market, the price will go like this. But if IPO comes and a bear market starts, then it's a problem. What happened with PTM? Same problem. That the IPOed in a bad market. I mean, it IPOed and then the market became bad. Okay. Now that is not something that PTM can do anything about. Okay. Now then comes, you know what? There is a lot of speculation because when we invest and understood stocks, our money gets logged for six months. Okay. So you can't sell it because even founders can't sell it. Otherwise, you know, Ritesh Agraval will come. Right. He'll buy a lot of equity and unlisted and first day of the IPO will sell everything and run on me. Okay. So that to prevent that, um, CB has a rule that founders or early investors cannot sell their equity for at least six months. So there is a six month lock in period. Okay. Now that's not just for us. That's for even the founders. Okay. So it's not as if that we are losing. Then comes that okay. If that is the case, then what's the guarantee that I'll see guarantee is okay. Okay. So this you have to do your own risk reward. But think about its structure. For example, Ritesh Agraval. Right. Is the founder of OEO. When will he make money? When he is able to liquidate his prizes or his stock at good prizes. Okay. For example, right now, if even unlisted guys unlisted are early investors. We are buying let's say OEO at let's say 350 rupees hypothetically. Okay. And Ritesh Agraval entire objective is that you know what? One day I'll be able to exit it at like maybe 1500 rupees because that's the only company that he's building. You are still investing like 100 different companies. But Ritesh Agraval might not even have a stock portfolio. Yeah. He picks a salary right now. And 99% of his wealth is logged with OEO's great. Okay. If it IPO's well, if it does well, then he makes a lot of money. If IPO, not as good and all that stuff. So he will focus all his energy. Now how do they build the book? So here you need to understand how Ritesh Agraval might be building the book of IPO. No, sorry, building the book of building the book for OEO. So what they do is that for example, it's not like free market. You know what? Okay. OEO IPO. It goes like 450 then it falls like 250 and all that stuff. No. So number one point is that they find out investment bankers who can help them IPO. For example, codex security, ZGTFC, all these people are bookbuilders. They run their own mutual funds. Okay. For example, HDFC, Koteq, Vanu, Khaanak, Khaanak, Koteq has a mutual fund also. It's map is IP. So your money goes to buying these type of companies. So they become counter by us. So it's a web of complications at the backend. Okay. So what I'm trying to tell you is that investment bankers also make money if the IPO goes well. Ritesh Agraval also makes money when the IPO goes well and sustains. Okay. So for example, Vijay Shekar Sharma has not liquidated his equity in PTM because it is not doing really well. Okay. He will only be able to liquidate it at some stage when PTM does well. Okay. So to cut the long story short, this is complicated. These type of stocks you get last in two or if you are a very patient guy, then you can do that. Right. But the thought process of investing is very simple for me. That if I'm getting some kind of good valuation, good brand, which will survive for five years, I don't care too much. For example, I have no intention of selling like NSC stock in the next two years. Okay. It's okay. I'll just buy it now. I'll hold it for five, six years and if I'm getting 10, 11, X, that's huge returns for me. So that's I'm happy. I'm putting like it's much more sensible for me to buy NSC compared to a one small cap stock. Okay. So we are getting why? Okay. So I will treat NSC stock as Bitcoin. Okay. So that's how I will look at it because it's almost guaranteed to win as long as you're buying cheap. But if you play the LIC game on it, okay. So what happened with LIC? Okay. LIC. LIC. Okay. Here is LIC. Okay. Now what happened with LIC? It opened at 826. There is huge up move and it is going to be a lot of people bought it here, exited here in loss after like one year. Okay. Because government companies, there is massive speculation that starts to happen right at the IPO stage. Okay. Because everyone understands government companies, they are super excited to buy it. Okay. So they will buy it whatever price it's they treat it as bank evades, money when NSM. So if you're going to make it, right. And then it becomes like a problem for government also. So therefore when it comes to NSC, and NSC is a very prized asset because it is a complete monopoly. Okay. So unlike LIC, LIC is a LIC that you will have instances when you are going to have to invest in LIC agents, right. This is the number of people who are going to open a new account and all that stuff. Right. So for example, etc, etc. Right. So such BS is at least not happening on NSC business model. Right. If you want to trade NSC, you will make some money out of it for whatever like brokerage, etc. So it's not like a bad product connotation or bad product association with NSC. NSC is a solid company, right. And it will remain like a solid company, right. And it has like a wha
