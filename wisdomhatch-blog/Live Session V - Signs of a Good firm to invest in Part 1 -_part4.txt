SUMMARY:
**  
The text critiques government intervention in business, arguing that it discourages private enterprise, creates inefficiencies, and fosters crony capitalism. Examples include taxi apps like Goa Miles (government-run) and cases like Anil Ambani's reliance on public banks, contrasting them with private-sector successes like Zomato and Asian Paints. The speaker emphasizes the importance of competitive markets, distribution networks, and brand value in sustaining businesses, while warning against debt-driven growth and monopolistic practices.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Government intervention** in businesses (e.g., taxi apps) stifles competition and innovation, leading to inefficiency.  
- **Crony capitalism** is highlighted through examples like Anil Ambani's debt reliance on public banks and Adani's port funding.  
- **Private-sector strengths** (e.g., Zomato’s delivery network, Asian Paints’ distribution and brand) drive customer-centric growth.  
- **Distribution and brand loyalty** (e.g., Asian Paints’ hub-and-spoke model) are critical for long-term business success.  
- **Debt dependency** (e.g., public funding for billionaires' projects) distorts markets without improving efficiency.  
- **Framework for analysis:** Evaluate revenue streams, competitive advantages, and value chains (e.g., Zomato’s food delivery vs. Q-commerce).  
- **Supply chain dynamics** (e.g., input costs, distribution) matter more than manufacturing complexity in industries like paints.  
- **Market competition** ensures better prices/services for customers, unlike monopolistic or state-controlled systems.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
one who is building Ola, Uber, why will they do it? Okay. So it makes no sense. That's problem one. Okay. Problem two is that it creates a very bad president's for example, tomorrow, if I build like an EV fleet for something for delivery. Okay. Or if I build a business that, you know, where, you know, I'm bringing in efficiency. I'll always be scared that okay, tomorrow, government will come and you fall to get things, you win DC, you know, right. And then and it's a scare tactic. All it does is that it dissuades people from, you know, creating more businesses in a sensible way. Right. So that's what is there. Goa miles, for example, the app that people can use in Goa, that's a government app. That's not a private app. Okay. It's a taxi union app in a way. Okay. It's not as if that, you know, you're getting any better like rates as customers. So all these are like, you know, massive inefficiencies. There is a reason why capitalism has survived for such a long period in time because it eventually benefits the customer. There is competition of service providers that there will be 10 options that you will have. The best guy at the best possible price will produce something or give you services at and you as a customer will win. But every time government steps in, they just kicks 70 80% of the business out. They themselves become inefficient and then they figure out okay, let's do PPP. Okay. So like eventually we'll hand it over to Adani Ji and he will run taxi, you know, operator in India now. Right. So let's give him another line of 10 billion dollars. Okay. Whatever crap. Right. So it's just mindlessness. Okay. That is there. Right. So that's the bottom line. Right. And when DCN all is not going to kill like Zomato, there is a reason why these companies are there. Now very quickly. Now very quickly. Right. See guys, I have nothing against Adani Ji, but let me give you an example. Okay. So which is one of the talking points also. Okay. And you guys think that okay, XYZ billionaire is like so nice. Right. And they have worked really hard to get there. Yes, they have. Okay. But what is like, for example, let me tell you the story of Anil Ammani. Right. So Anil Ammani destroyed a company called as reliance comm. Okay. He drove that stock to zero for bunch of different reasons. Then assets that were there. So for example, this process is called as asset liquidation that whatever like factories, machines, the company had, they were liquidated. And the company also had debt. Okay. So like 500 cross six hundred or whatever. Right. Now who bought the assets that were there, location money, okay, off our home. Okay. And debt, who gave debt to Anil Ammani. You will say, I did not give right. Okay. Fine. So who gave. Okay. So he'll say as B.I. And what type of banks gave debt to Anil Ammani public banks? Why not HDFC and all. Okay. So they gave debt. Now do you now try searching? How much debt does location money has right now? And Adani has right now. Okay. Do you think all the ports are getting made for free? Right. Who is funding all that operation? You give me like $10 trillion. I'll become a trillionaire. I'll open like 20 ports for you out there. I don't create like 10 airports for you. Do you think that that's complicated? No. Getting debt is very complicated. Okay. That's the problem. And you as a public are funding for that entire operation with no efficiency in play. Right. So it's not like a personal hate against anyone. It's just crony capitalism. It's known as crony capitalism. Russian billionaires are the richest people in the world. Right. Why? Because that parts of Russia was sold off to the highest bidders. Okay. Same exact thing is happening in India right now. Look look around right. Playbreen. Okay. There is no personal animosity I have with anyone. Okay. And you yourself will be able to see do a little bit of business analysis. Okay. So but wrapping up the point around mode. Right. So very quickly these five factors you check. This is a framework that you can use. Okay. Now in mode analysis. Right. We look at like key success business line wise. For example, Zomato has let's say five business lines. One is let's say food delivery. Okay. Second might be with commerce. Right. Which is the two and all that right. So third would be let's say tickets or entertainment. Fourth could be something else. Right. So you check the revenue streams of every business and try to figure out the winning advantage. Okay. Winning advantage. Right. So this is what you need to figure out that okay, why will food delivery mode survive for Zomato? Right. Because they have a huge delivery network very hard to replicate those five factors. Q commerce may you do the same. Right. Ticket events may you do the same. XYZ business may you do the same. Right. And you have to do this mode analysis on a on that basis. Okay. And you need to see Zomato's business model in context of their larger a tab. Okay. So which was which is always the case that hey, is the company reaching out to new customers or not. Okay. For example, someone asked me that hey, the example that you gave of Britannia that their time is fixed or Tata Motors that their time is fixed. What about Asian paints versus let's say indigo paints. Same problem there. No, that okay. For example, this is Asian paints. Majority of their business comes from what paints. Now, okay. Now is paint like a big industry and can Asian paints keep on growing? The short answer is that how do you categorize this stock? Okay. So for example, Asian paints, what is the winning advantage for Asian paints? Or what is the key success factors? So there are two factors. Number one is quality slash brand because many people want to do like Asian paints well up paint only. Okay. Why? Because they might paint their house once every five six years. And at least if there's a difference of 10, 15,000 on my entire painting cost 15, 20,000, I'll rather just buy like a slightly more expensive one and be done with it. Okay. And the second key thing is distribution. Right. Now, how do you think like for example, majority of the manufacturing oriented business in India are distribution driven businesses? Now, what is the meaning of distribution? For example, it's a hub and spoke model. It's not as if that's someone from like Asian paints factory picks up bucket of paint and start selling a tree. They will go. So this is called as analyzing value chain. Okay. So value chain of Asian paints might look something like this that Asian paints will manufacture a bucket of paint. Okay. Or like whatever one million buckets. Okay. Then they will give it to their distributor. Okay. Now this distributor gives it to like for example, this might be a North India distributor. Now this guy's goes to like you know, three cities in North India. Now, now this is a wholesaler. Right. So where will be I got right. So this is called as hub and spoke model. So this model is very hard to replicate. Right. Now on this distribution chain or Asian paints, there will be like maybe you know, five thousand partners. So replicating this model is very, very complicated. Okay. Because when you own a shop, for example, the eventual end point guy is owning a shop in let's say in the world. What is his cost? His cost is running this shop. If Asian paints sells well, then he also makes money. But if he puts like Magnum Opus or whatever the paint is, right. And if that does not sell well, he's also losing revenue because he also has to pay like shop rent and whatever. Right. So here like is the company treating its distributors fairly, right. Are they happy with it? That's very important point that do they even want to retain. And second is that what is the brand value of the company? Okay. Now when it comes to paint business, the you have to understand that there is something called a supply change. Okay. So supply chain means that and it's very simple. This is how you would need to analyze every business. That for example, if you look at Asian paints, there is something called as input cost. For example, and then there is processing. And there is marketing distribution. These will be three levels, right. So for example, let's say Asian paints, input cost will be oil. Right. So this is where oil prices addicted that whatever chemicals they are extracting and making paints from now, if that barrel of oil costs $100, their price point will, you know, this will eventually let's say the entire bucket is getting sold for 1000 rupees. Okay. To the end customer. This cost itself might make like, you know, 500 rupees, right. And this can vary from 250 rupees to 500 rupees. Right. If the oil prices are high, then you have to pay 500. If the oil prices are low, you have to pay 250. Then processing fee and marketing and distribution. Now this is not a complex manufacturing game. Okay. Anyone can manufacture paint. Even I can manufacture paint. It's not that hyper complicated. Okay. What is complicated is so now if it is not a very complicated manufacturing game, then what is the entire game about? Number one thing, what is the mode of the company distribution that hey, can you get your product out faster? Okay. Because the cost for everything or cost of production is not going to differ massively. For example, if let's say you will say that, okay, Indigo paint I got and it is going to start offering this 1000 to be paid at 800 to peace. Now, what do you think Asian paints is going to do? It is going to do it at 900 or 815, right. Now I'll go as a buyer and I'll say that, okay, Indigo paint I'm going to add some of it right. This is this I'm getting at 850. Asian paints here. Why are they will they be able to do this? Will they be able to like, you know, cost cut in this a strong brand will they be able to cost cut on it on this. The short on there is yes. Okay. Five years from now, will people still require paints in their house or would they be doing yes?
