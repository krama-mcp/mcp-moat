==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a conversational discussion covering various investment topics, including angel investing, supply dynamics of unlisted stocks, valuation metrics like price-to-book ratio (especially for public sector banks), transitioning from mutual funds to direct stock investing, strategies during market downturns (parabolic falls), and practical challenges for part-time investors. The speaker emphasizes the importance of confidence, gradual transitions, and top-down analysis while debunking the universal applicability of traditional valuation metrics like price-to-book ratios in today's market.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Angel Investing:** Lower ticket sizes and diversify across multiple companies to mitigate risk.  
- **Unlisted Stocks:** Supply is limited and not infinite like publicly listed stocks; availability depends on sellers.  
- **Valuation Metrics:** Price-to-book (P/B) ratio is relevant for public sector banks/PSUs but less so for companies with significant brand value (e.g., Apple). Brand value is increasingly important post-COVID.  
- **Transitioning to Direct Stocks:** Move gradually from mutual funds—start with a small portion (e.g., 10%) to test direct investing before fully committing.  
- **Parabolic Falls:** These are clear buying opportunities; timing the bottom is impractical, but accumulating during steep declines is a sound strategy.  
- **Passive Investing:** Index-based investing can be effective without stock-picking, allowing capital rotation and simplicity.  
- **Part-Time Investors:** For those with demanding jobs, focus on a manageable subset of stocks or passive strategies rather than tracking numerous assets. Missed exits (e.g., HDFC AMC) highlight the need for systematic tracking or delegation.  
- **Top-Down Analysis:** Prioritize macro trends before diving into individual stocks (to be covered in advanced sessions).  
- **Avoid Overanalysis:** Tracking thousands of stocks is impractical; a curated universe (e.g., 150 stocks) with steady growth suffices.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 just invest in one lose that money then it's not worth it right and angel investing you have to lower the ticket size and invest across a broad range of companies okay thanks thanks Sabia yeah thank you HDB unless it no longer available is the opportunity lost I can they give options see what happens is the supply gets exhausted right on the primary market right so if they don't have the supply we can't list it on the platform right it's not like you know buying publicly listed stock publicly listed stock is available all that time but for unlisted stocks supply has to be created you have to find people who want to sell their stock okay so that supply is not infinite okay no no I'm not like you know I'm no interest in you know taking VC money it just points like my lifestyle I'm a very relaxed lifestyle I you know I don't want to like take anyone's money right so yeah appal basil yeah yeah good afternoon actually my question is why be to a financial why not price to book in earlier in one of your videos you have said about the price to book is much more important to value a financial firm no I did not say price to book I would have said price to book for public sector banks okay or public sector units PSUs right because typically public sector banks PSUs in the past they used to have brand bad brand image now there is no brand value P that gets added right so therefore price to book basically indicates the true value of the asset how accountants create book value so in price to book B means book value right book value means that okay if the firms asset for example Punjab national bank has 100 branches and they own all these 100 branches then you liquidate all the branches you liquidate all the computers sell off so this is the value of the firm that comes okay now in this there is no what do you call there is no factoring in of the brand Pnv okay so because in the past public sector units used to have typically a very bad image right PB ratio used to work really well for public sector enterprises but now what has happened is that if you actually go and because of the blank bank cleanup and all that what has started to happen is that the even the brand recaligation of public sector units is coming into foray okay now in these type of companies price to book ratio kind of made sense you can't do price to book ratio for a company like Apple where majority of the price of the stock is derived from the brand value okay because accountants do not price in or in the book value there is no brand value that is like you know sort of added okay so yeah that's what I would say I hope that explanation kind of made sense I'll try to explain more subsequently okay okay so the price to be cannot be seen for a financial firm only thing we have to take it in PSU sector some days right also price to book I ignore completely I don't look at price to book anymore because brand value is there for almost all the businesses now especially after like COVID world right price to book used to be a very old ratio they've just continued it it doesn't make sense anymore right so yeah that's how I put it okay thank you on what basis you have sold the HTFC AMC maybe some technical number change or it is run up to 100% age which I sold it after that I didn't know very recently only a sold it right so yeah is there any specific thing that on this basis only how sold like that I'm asking when I sold it I explained the entire arsenal of selling it now I don't remember it one that sell it I sell it I'm sure there's a post also like on that right so okay good thank you thank you basal you guys yeah uh action like I'm investing in mutual funds since 2014 okay so what do you consider like should I stop investing and start moving into stocks or nifty and like that what do you suggest my suggestion is useless okay so basically you should have confidence in whatever you're doing okay so what I would recommend is that you try out investing in direct stocks if that looks more valuable to you pull right make the moves slow right you don't need to cut all your mutual funds and directly jump into stocks okay maybe liquidate 10% of your mutual fund portfolio play around with 10% stocks directly see the results if you like it if you're improving as an investor then liquidate like 20% 30% eventually move completely out right so if that is working out if that is not working out then also it's fine right I mean at least you would know when to liquidate your mutual fund right for example by looking at the technicals you can proxy it and liquidate your mutual funds okay one more question like you said during the parabolic fall like both d i's and the appraisers selling but this information is available to us only after after a period of time right so the parabolic fall but the parabolic falls happen almost on the same day right okay so that information is easily available instantly it's not like I want to see it so for example if you put this on daily handle right I mean if you just go and put it like let's say weekly handle right you'll see the parabolic fall right so for example this is not a parabolic this is not a parabolic right you'll see this is a parabolic right so you are clearly seeing it that this is a parabolic fall it's like on 9th March you would have seen it okay so this is parabolic and it continued to fall more right till 30th March right so this March like February to March period two months this was a parabolic fall so this was a great buying opportunity you buy whatever you can at any point on this curve will you be able to time the water absolutely not okay but the objective of a parabolic fall is to buy okay the moment you see a parabolic fall and realize that hey parabolic fall is happening you start buying like crazy whatever you can okay and ask what I'm going to do then right I am going to leverage mortgage all my properties and buy even more okay so that's how leverage I want to be I have zero loans right now I'm just waiting for a parabolic fall okay thank you yeah your gauge yeah I have a question you talked about P now marrying P to the DM a TMS 50 or a Dm I 200 will you be covering that or do you have it Giri Shah yes hey hi Akshad thanks for the session very quickly so you know are you going to teach us how to develop like a system of looking at things so for example like off all these stocks how do you track the best ones best opportunity and when there is a parabolic fall you're kind of ready to take advantage and not you know scrambling to buy anything at that point in time is that something you'll cover the honestly to make money from the stock market you don't even need to buy one single stock okay you can just literally play around with index and make money if you know how to operate in that segment really right that's honest I'm I'm being honest because it allows you to rotate capital it allows you to do a bunch of different things etc etc the I what people expect me to teach is that hey tell us like how to find the best stocks you can't do it you have to be a mad person to like you know keep on scouting stocks all your life okay that's useless okay the idea is then okay some stock is in front of you it's grabbing your attention then are you able to analyze it well and figure out that whether it should be a part of your system or not right so that's it right so the idea is not like I mean see there are 6,000 plus stocks now how many stocks will you set an analyze right I mean you cannot analyze it maximum your universe of stocks will be like let's say 150 stocks right out of that you will keep on adding deleting there will be hundreds of stocks that you will miss which will rally so yeah and as long as your portfolio is giving like sensible bonds you should not start comparing you to HL Valenet or 200% in terms of your but R stock did move only like 20 the ideas that is your portfolio growing sensibly sustainable you're not so that's what I'm trying to teach I'm not trying to teach like you know that you go and figure out like you keep on hunting for like new stocks every day right so that's impossible that ruins your piece of mind right because then you will be stuck in front of your screens already right so just one quick follow question is there what you do also like you know you have like a favorite set of like or you know set of 10 150 stocks that kind of catch your attention and then you kind of of of course they cover like a diverse sectors and then you kind of play around in those is that is that correct so you you start from top down right so this is an analysis that I'll teach you in the evening class that you start a top down analysis first right so far I've taught you that you should trust the market right by parabolic fall that's easy way of making money right the second step is that now how do you analyze like specific opportunities top down bottom up so this is the analysis that I will start teaching top to down bottom to operate so from evening this over okay thanks so much Kanchan Shubham Shuka yeah yeah actually so actually I'm part of your community for last couple of years and of the practical problem that I'm facing is so since I became part of your community I sort of started my own investment journey so till then I only use to invest through mutual fund out but I am in a very demanding job and I could be honest you are a full time investor you can keep on analyzing different assets different instruments maybe two and through but being in demanding job I cannot do that so I cannot really track so many assets when they are going down when they are coming up and to exit so for example taking an example of HDFC MC right I invested in it but I did not take the exit so I'm still invested in it way so how really what is your practical advisor guidance for investors like course who cannot track the various instruments maybe regularly because they are in demanding jobs see maybe you missed that post right becau
