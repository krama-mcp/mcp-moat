==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a conversation discussing investment strategies, particularly focusing on the differences between Indian and US markets, the impact of political policies (especially under Trump) on the US economy, and tax considerations for investors, especially non-resident Indians (NRIs) in the UAE. The speaker emphasizes the advantages of investing in the US market due to its pro-capitalist policies, tax benefits, and long-term growth potential. They also address risks like changing Indian regulations (e.g., TCS on foreign investments) and the importance of community and networking for collaborative investing. The dialogue includes questions from participants about diversifying into other markets like China or Japan and concerns about future tax changes in Dubai.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **US Market Advantage:** The US economy is highlighted as a strong investment destination due to pro-capitalist policies under Trump, including tax cuts, efficiency measures, and revenue generation through geopolitical leverage.  
- **Tax Efficiency for NRIs:** NRIs in the UAE are advised to invest predominantly in the US (90-95%) to benefit from tax-free long-term capital gains (vs. India's 12.5% advantage).  
- **Risks for Indian Investors:** Sending money abroad (e.g., via vested accounts) carries regulatory risks, such as potential increases in TCS (Tax Collected at Source) by the Indian government to discourage foreign investments.  
- **Diversification Options:** ETFs like GXC or the Hang Seng Index are suggested for exposure to China, while overvalued Indian small/mid-cap stocks should be sold first.  
- **Community Benefits:** Networking with like-minded investors can lead to opportunities like syndicate investing (e.g., group property purchases for discounts).  
- **Future Tax Concerns in UAE:** While UAE currently has no capital gains tax, any future changes are unlikely to be applied retrospectively to existing investments.  
- **Policy Over Personality:** The speaker separates Trump's controversial personality from his pro-market policies, focusing on their economic impact.  
- **India as Diversification:** For UAE-based investors, India should remain a minor diversification play (~5-10%) due to tax inefficiencies.  
- **Practical Action Steps:** Encourage active participation in investment communities, attending sessions, and leveraging shared resources (e.g., WhatsApp notes, website updates).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
use honestly you are putting like a lot of your hard-earned money on the line so even if you have to spend like another 10 hours watching these it's worth it right from the ringer just watch it once extract the essence and be out that you don't need to rewatch this anyways whatever I'm going I'm anyway is going to write like byte size notes for you on whatsapp so now the question comes that can you act on it for example if tomorrow I show the commentary hypothetically that by like xyz stock like or indicate that by xyz stock if it's an Indian stock then it it it really depends on your confidence level whether you're able to do it or not okay thank you so much yeah all right Kishot yes yeah thanks so much for this insightful sessions last couple of weekends and it was really helpful I have one like small question so basically let's say right now you mentioned right whenever some investing style matured that it turns out diminished basically so for example SIPs were very good for some duration for the last let's say few last 10 years now SIPs have lost so how about you how do you see us talk investing in from that sense from foreign investors basically is that yeah so that's that's not us talk investing is not comparable to SIP investing right us talk people are misguided about like us economy us economy is the number one customer base out there okay trump is bringing a lot of businesses back to the US trump US was a very slow conventional corporate type of economy trump came and the type of moves that he has made these are very pro capitalist moves he has put US ahead in the map now right I mean he has pushed US by like 10 years at least okay so I like I know like I'll get a lot of like negativity trump is like this person that person see I'm not commenting on his personality okay I'm just commenting on his policy actions from a capitalism point of view and how it drives the market for example and this is something that I've tweeted also that for example the total debt repayment of the US is $1 trillion what trump has done is that he has created doge now how do you repay that you'd repay that either by increasing taxes or spending less yeah so US government plans on spending less now where are the cutting down spending by doge which is Elon Musk right so Elon Musk is responsible for cutting like half the government yes we inspire people at scale and bureaucrats are dead of it's okay so like that you are seeing an India also it's just not like you know something that is there only in like US or something right so it's an over bloated government so he's cutting like creating efficiency by that second thing that he's doing is that he is bringing revenues now how is we bringing revenues so some countries which he can bully for example India you better carry them and I'm all right and pay like whatever 15 20% RF if you don't do it I'll mess you up right so that's what he has simply stated in like closed-door meetings and many countries will have to bend backwards except for China and maybe like handful of two three more countries everyone will have to bend down to his wishes okay so he'll make a additional revenue there third is that he's cutting taxes because a lot of US millionaires I keep on meeting a lot of these guys here in Dubai so a lot of US millionaires their problem was that he and what was US is like really bad on taxation right so I mean the taxes are really high now if you are able to like bring down taxes what does that ensure it ensures that a lot of quality people actually want to live in the US so he's trying to retain that talent so if you look at it from a five-year basis US is on a positive trajectory so there is nothing to fear and it's actually great even for India because if US progress is some advantages float to us yeah but second question is like for an Indian investor apart from like for example vested takes via via SDF we are able to convert INR to USD and then invest so apart from like SDFs taking that Forex transaction charges is there any other risk that you see either like government risk or any other risk of sending money from India to abroad because for me for stable future it is for me converting tax residency from India to another country right now is not feasible maybe at a later point in time so any other risk that you see for doing this see structural risk is that you know this will be discouraged with time right because the TCS is also sorry TCS is also a new rule it's what was not there before like 2022 so this rule came into effect either 2022 or 2023 now what will happen is that if Indian government wants to discourage people from sending USD abroad or sending INR to buy ULT abroad what they are going to do is they are going to just jack up this TCS so other than that there's no risk and third point basically so going forward do I expect all your YouTube commentary also to be part of that WhatsApp community it will be similar right okay thank you thank you so much yes Arat kurpreeth yes hi hi sir thanks for this session actually so I want to call session because initially I thought that you are doing less than the PPT and you know as like other partners but you know you take in the live examples and it's very you know it's good actually for us my first question is that I am in Sarja actually I'm in Majas 3 only okay so I've just started investing because I am started following from 2023 onwards because before that I'm watching some other YouTubers and I have started investing in India right now you said that you know 60% in India 40% in the US but I'm basically in Sarja so is it possible to you know of invest fully full amount in that you know in US market or in Indian market how how you doing that actually see honestly like if you are a tax resident of UAE you should be investing 90 95% of your money in US market not India market India should be a diversification play right so there is no sense for you to give up on that tax benefit that you're getting so even I over time in the next three four years I'll be like 80 90% US not India okay not because I have like not because I'm not bullish on India but because of the fact that it's 12 and a half percent advantage for me right which is guaranteed that's okay I am part of that US portfolio NR community and I'm part of the YouTube membership also so I'm following you actually to for the US market I'm just following you are portfolio and my second question is that if it is want to be invest in China or Japan okay stock markets so how we want to be invested through yeah so maybe I did not make it explicit so for example here is ETF list and if you want to buy China you can buy something like GXC because that's one way of investing in China there's something called as Hanseng index that's another index that you could purchase there is a large gap China market so that you can also buy so multiple options are there okay okay my portfolio in India is actually I have diodesized with the sectors wise actually hence the insurance more like that I have diversified so in that case which I need to sell now if you see anything that goes overvalued right so I mean you sell that first right wherever you see overvaluation for example if you have small cap mid cap stocks sell it okay if you have small cap mid cap active once sell it first if individual stocks do not make sense from a fundamental analysis right where the quality of the asset is questionable sell it first so that's how I would approach but it's I cannot like you know sort of issue like a structure to do it okay so I want to part of this even what you're going to conduct into buy right so how I will get that information in the NRE community or how to know so so it's already there on our website right so if you just search for it you'll get it otherwise I'll post it not in the show on the group right so I'll make a post right today or tomorrow right and you can take a look right thank you definitely I mean I'll encourage like you guys at least to attend right because honestly like it's very difficult to network in Dubai right so I mean it's always good to have like I'll give you an example right for example if you're looking to buy a property in Dubai right so I bought my first property in Dubai with three other investors so we bought it on the same floor four properties from one investor now because we are buying four in four properties from one single investor he gave us a good so we anyways got like 10% discount on a property which is like crazy okay so because he had to individually go and like hire four brokers and you know pay them like brokerage and all that so what's up ginger to scard here right and this is called a syndicate investing you can only do this if you find like minded people so that is the benefit of community right and yeah so I mean that's what already brought up property actually in Sarja already I bought a villa so it's in the lower actually as you said I want the massage did you buy no I buy in you know sustainability h okay thank you very much yeah okay good treat so on I actually first of all bless you and thanks for your time when I put what if I create I build a portfolio of 10 years down the line I build a portfolio around any like three C-R-5 here in the US for example and I moved to Dubai for tax saving tax and then 10 years we don't know Dubai maybe imposes 10% 20% LTC so games sorry the problem maybe like so like see it's not taxation is typically not retrospective okay now what is the meaning of that is that for example this 12.5% LTCG this gets applied from 2024 or whatever 2023 okay it does not get applied from assets that you had bought before that okay so even if that happens whatever 35% portfolio that you are building up until let's say 2030 if this LTCG in the UAE also comes in 2030 then you you get what I'm trying to say right I mean it's not as if that you know it will hit you before your 2013 investments that's one second is that fro
