SUMMARY:
**  
The transcript is from a live session discussing investment strategies, focusing on when and how to sell investments to book profits, particularly in the context of cross-border taxation and unlisted stocks. The conversation covers challenges with Indian mutual funds for non-residents, taxation implications in Singapore and the UAE, and methods for buying unlisted stocks through platforms like NKRID Money or traditional brokers. The speaker emphasizes the importance of tax planning, due diligence in stock selection, and long-term horizons for unlisted investments.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
1. **Taxation Challenges with Indian Mutual Funds**: Non-residents (e.g., in Singapore/UAE) face difficulties transferring Indian mutual funds abroad; selling triggers taxable events in India, requiring careful planning.  
2. **Unlisted Stock Investments**: Platforms like NKRID Money facilitate buying pre-IPO stocks, regulated by Indiaâ€™s MCA. Prices may be lower than private wealth management routes but involve IPO timing risks.  
3. **Due Diligence and Long-Term View**: Investors must analyze companies individually (e.g., hospital/finance stocks) and hold unlisted stocks for 3+ years to mitigate liquidity and valuation risks.  
4. **Regulation and Trust**: Unlisted spaces are regulated; partnering with established platforms (e.g., NKRID) adds safety. Traditional brokers offer alternative but costly options.  
5. **Educational Goal**: The session aims to equip attendees to critically evaluate investment advice rather than becoming analysts, emphasizing structured decision-making.

 All right, Sonam and Hersch, a key is we quit guys less right or none and structure yourself from a taxation point of view that way with time point. Right, right. This is another start of the back. Actually, Hi. I go first. Yeah, sure. Actually, I've been hearing your advice on, you know, that I was working in India until 2022 and started buying mutual funds around 2015. So and still buy. So now because I'm in Singapore, I just want to understand that should I be exiting it or there is a long term. Can't do anything once so that's the problem in the Indian market and that's the reason why I feel this entire sip is a scam. Yeah. Yeah. reason is that you can't move your account. For example, if you have a vested account with. In India right now. And let's say that you're right now in Indian tax resident after 1015 and you're buying like Google Amazon this that stuff. And after 15 years, you become a hypothetically like when you find a job in UAE and you know you come here and whatever. Then you can effectively transfer that account from. Because it's with a US company. It's called as well that right. Okay. So technically you can link that account to your UAE bank. Okay. And then you sell that account entirely. You're liquidating and you're paying 0% LTCG. But in order to liquidate Indian mutual funds, you can't move Indian mutual funds to UAE. Okay. So you have to first sell it. Get pay whatever taxes. Get that money. Then move that money into UAE. And then you can buy. And then you can buy. Indian mutual funds with that money. Okay. Okay. So but then your advice should would be that you know we should still go and sell it now instead of keeping it. There is no upside down outside of that because that money you anyways will have to pay tax at some stage. That we never with the right. Exactly. This is the same problem that I have right. I mean, for example, I built a very big India based portfolio, which was extremely stupid on my part. Because if I would have thought about tax residency and all that was some of these were featured in the VT. Right. So then. Like, since now with the Singapore tax regime where you know, I pay tax only either in Singapore or in India. I'm paying it in Singapore. So when I do a selling in India for the Indian profits there, I still have to pay the taxes. That's how it's not how it goes. Right. So that's what Samir Arow was also saying. Right. And he is also saying that, was he going to get all of the taxes and then that money which you want to pay. That's right. And then I said to him, That's how it's goes. So that's what Samiruraro was also saying. Right. And he's also Singapore based. Right. So since I don't know much about Singapore, because I'm not treated via Singapore. I'm building a company there now. So I'll understand more. But as I know about UAE, I can talk more. But even in Singapore, that's my understanding that if you're a foreign investor from Singapore, investing in the Indian market, you still have to pay. On equities, you still have to pay taxes. OK. Which means by default, you have to pay taxes on mutual funds also. OK. Got it. What's company are you building? Would love to know if you're in Singapore anytime soon. Let us know. Yeah, I'm sure. I'll be with you in Singapore soon, man. So I'll keep you posted. Please. Thank you. So no, yes. Hi, Alshad. I just wanted to check with you based on all your steps of analysis. So, Bozing, I wanted to choose a hospital or a finance top for my portfolio. And we listed out on screen now. Can you show some way of how to shortlist those stocks and maybe choose one? No. So there's automation. Right? I mean, you guys are expecting me to tell you automation. You have to go through a check. No. So you should analyze each of those companies separately and then choose it. Yes. Exactly. And honestly, you don't even need to analyze everything because you'll anyways watch some YouTube video, some like someone would say, for example, some hero or I would say that who you stock would be here. And I will say that who you stock would be here. Right? I'll follow on and you'll be right. So the point is that you'll get enticed by that. So my goal of this course is not that you become like a equity analyst. The goal is that if someone is throwing some information at you, how can you structurally analyze it and take action accordingly, your portfolio? OK. Open for it. And another thing was, as I think the question towards the end is, I'll miss teaching. So how do we go about buying unlisted companies? Now see, two, three things. One is that if you have an account with infinite money, there are other companies like that. So you can buy, why are them? They help you buy unlisted stocks. Are they safe? Yes. Why? Because unlisted space is regulated by something called as Ministry of Cochrane Tafas, MCA. And the moment the company files for an DRHP, that is IPO, they all under the purview of CB. So this is already a regulated space. It's not as if that these companies have suddenly cropped up and they are taking money illegally nothing of that sort. What can happen is that they might put additional nonsense to start this. So for example, at Platform X, they will quote NSC as let's say 1630. At some platform, they might quote 1700. Now what ends up happening is that there would be additional facilities involved in it. For example, companies like NKRID, they can help you resell your stock also subsequently. And they might charge you less for that service. Now that's a facility. Some would only be sellers. They would not help you list your equity in the primary market and sell it. It's also about just internal safety of the company. So just work with a bigger group. Because I have, I work with NKRID money in the sense that I am an angel investor in it. I have had a long term association with them. I know the team. I know that NKRID, you guys yourself search for it. So for example, NKRID is the parent group. You search about NKRID. Now NKRID money is a subsidiary of NKRID. But that does is that it lends at least a unicorn status to the company. So yeah, so that's the bottom line. You cannot typically trade it because it's your customer who responds to it. So that's the bottom line that there is a level of trust that I have with them. I cannot say the same about others. So this is one option that you can do. Second, if you say that no, I don't want to try these platforms. No problem. You go to HDFC securities, Edelweiss, etc. to their private wealth management teams if you are dealing at such large levels of money. Tell them I want to buy this stock. Can you get me the sourcing? And they will figure it out. Then they will sell it to you at whatever rate you negotiate with it. It's like private Swiss banking. So that's the bottom line. But typically in the second option, it will be the price will be very high. In the first option, if you're buying it directly through NKRID money or some other platforms, the prices will be typically lower. So it's very similar to how banks and new banks operate. That new banks charges are less compared to traditional banks. But you will always feel slightly more safety dealing with traditional banks compared to new banks. So that's how the story is. Can we sell them before IPO? Technically, yes. You can sell them. But that's not the goal of buying. Unlisted. You can sell them. That's that can be done. So that's that. I'll make more notes and I'll share more notes with you about unlisted. So you'll stop the unlisted topic here. Because otherwise I'll miss what I had to teach for this class. But I hope that these seven-aid type of stocks are clear when do you buy them, turn around stories, etc. You cannot buy unlisted from zero. So unlisted. Zero that does not put unlisted. And zero that isn't public markets. Right? The platform that you see, it's public market. For example, now, it's up to like a month, month and a half. You're a swiggy listing that you would have bought from NKRID money. It will start getting featured onto your zero account if you have listed that. To buy unlisted stocks, you can just you need a trading account first. So because you have to give your D-mat number. So without a trading account, you can't buy an unlisted stock. So it directly gets linked to your trading account. The moment you buy an unlisted stock, you will get a receipt for this. So it's not as if capnash got it, you got a company, you got it, and whatever. So then you will not be able to get your stock. No, it's directly it's held by like a deposit. Lock-in period I've already spoken. It's six months. So after IPO, right? The uncertainty risk that you're taking with unlisted companies is when will they IPO? For example, many of you have been messaging me, you know, what, which, go play was it's all right and whatever, like in NS here, you know, they will not IPO for like two years. I'm regular, by regulation, don't you know? Right? I mean, it's a government company. Of course, they are going to take time to IPO and all that. But even in unlisted space, the valuations can keep going up. Okay. So bottom line being that, you know, it kind of makes sense to build some positions unlisted and some positions listed with at least a three year viewpoint. If you don't have that three or four year viewpoint on these type of stocks, do not enter. Okay. If you guys want, I'll send you like a link because I'm an angel investor, they'll give you special discounts to my students. Okay. So that's not an issue. Okay. So I'll push them and that will be useful. Okay. So I'll put this on the WhatsApp group if that helps. Okay. Good. Otherwise, you can buy it from anywhere. Okay. Who is selling? So for example, many people, early investors, for example, let's say s
