SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses how companies and billionaires, such as Anil Ambani, Amazon, Apple, and Meta, borrowed heavily during 2020-2021 due to historically low interest rates (e.g., 0.25%). It highlights how cheap debt fueled growth, liquidity, and stock market rallies, even during economic downturns like COVID-19. The author critiques India’s lack of fixed-rate loans, where banks adjust rates unfavorably for borrowers. They advise borrowing in low-rate environments (e.g., 6.5% home loans) but repaying debt in high-rate scenarios (e.g., 9%). The analysis ties global central bank liquidity injections (e.g., $23 trillion post-2008) to market booms, arguing that liquidity—not fundamentals—drives short-term stock performance. The future hinges on whether liquidity continues expanding or contracts.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Cheap Debt Spurs Borrowing:** Companies and billionaires borrowed aggressively during 2020-2021 due to near-zero interest rates, leveraging debt for growth.  
- **Liquidity Drives Markets:** Central bank money printing (e.g., $23 trillion post-2008) inflated asset prices, with India’s Nifty rising 50% during COVID despite economic stagnation.  
- **Interest Rate Timing Matters:** Borrow in low-rate environments (e.g., 6.5% home loans) but prioritize debt repayment when rates are high (e.g., 9%).  
- **Critique of India’s Loan System:** Variable-rate loans in India disadvantage borrowers, as banks add margins and adjust rates unpredictably.  
- **Liquidity > Fundamentals:** Short-term market gains are more tied to liquidity injections than company fundamentals, emphasizing the risk of liquidity withdrawal.  
- **Future Uncertainty:** Whether global liquidity doubles (e.g., to $60 trillion) or halves will dictate asset price trajectories.  
- **Risk Management:** Avoid speculative investments (e.g., stocks) to service debt in volatile, high-rate environments.  

*Note:* The text’s informal style and repetitive phrasing were streamlined for clarity in the analysis.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
d borrowers okay Anil Ammani for example relatively drove the lines calm to the ground right so he lost multiple billion dollars of wealth he's again a billionaire why because he was able to get more loans okay okay so same story played out in 2020 that who borrowed crazy amount of money in 2020 tech companies why did they borrow Amazon Apple Meta every one borrowed crazy amount of money okay for example you can get an understanding again whatever I'm telling you just fact check okay so for example go here go to publicity right just simply ask publicity how much money did Amazon borrow in 2021 when 2020 2021 enter yeah and it will tell you the answer okay so it's very simple okay okay so here is like the total amount of debt so they borrowed six borrowed approximately 10 billion dollar through its board offerings or board and I did not take any new debt as it was using a system so 2020 with the borrowed 10 billion dollars okay which is a lot of money right so substantial amount of money similarly if you run the analysis you will see that a lot of money was borrowed by rich billionaires reliance borrowed a lot of money Adani's borrowed a lot of money etc etc okay so to cut the long story short what was happening these companies were borrowing crazy amount of money why were they borrowing crazy amount of money because they were getting loans cheap at 0.25 if the situation was 2.5 you still have to pay a lot of money and I see guys I'm just using it as a baseline rate the borrowing rate for a company will be different right this is the base rate okay but whenever the base rate falls it means generally the interest rates also are following falling okay okay now you say that okay I could not borrow so should you have borrowed in 2020 yes even your home loan rates would have been really low in 2020 2021 the next time the interest rates go go low should you borrow yes borrowing generally is not a bad idea but borrowing in a high interest rate environment is a bad idea now comes the next corrupt a bit okay I'll expose like all the corruption that okay see in India we don't have the concept of fixed rate loans for people like us and what do I mean for example if you go and check this right you will see that it's 4.5 right now right and one day I mean and now Fed has started to cut the interest rate and it will settle like somewhere here because this was it 2019 rate now if you are getting loan rates rates here so right now home rates in India would be somewhere around 8.5% okay but if the base rate falls from 4.5 to 2.5 this home loan rate will be around like 7% 6.5% now if you are getting home loan rates at 6.5% should you borrow and buy real estate in India the answer is yes okay but what's the problem the problem is that in India we don't have fixed loan rates okay I'll say not as I was told to you see it automatically read just after two three years whatever that thing is and more over this fixed there is a cap or there is a like a what do you call margin that the bank already adds to the variable okay for example they'll say that she was if you're taking like a loan from HDFC you can take a variable home rate rate at like whatever likes it but if you want to fixed you have to pay half a percent more that's what is it okay so why is that because banks are crooks I keep on saying best investments right so you buy banks have never customized screw them right so that's a simple point right so I'm a bit cool to go back to the bank policy right don't go so on that right so they are June all are going to have for it so there is like crazy right so I mean there is nothing that you can do okay on that that is what the situation is okay now how to deal with that problem how I am dealing with that problem I'll probably if we have find more time I'll try to explain that right however what is my strategy of taking more debt but what I'm trying to tell you is that see if you want to borrow like new money wait for interest rates to come down okay right now someone asked me a question should I repay my home loan yes okay because we are still in a high interest rate environment so if you can repay your loans it's good thing okay some people say that you know what my interest my home loan interest rate is 9 but I can make 10% from stock market should I do that pay loans first India is a high cost of borrowing country okay so always pay our home home loans and all those loans keep as less debt as possible in a high interest rate environment because debt is a fixed outflow you don't know what your financial situation might be a job then what right so I'm a falthulia required and you have put that money in stock market stock market also down debt also there on your head so don't play don't take risks that you can't digest okay that's an important bit okay but I hope like you know this first point so just quickly wrapping up the loop let's see what happens is that the government will say that 20 20 type situation right we want to throw more money into the economy how can we do it so RBI what it will do is that RBI will in a way print from 5 trillion dollar it will increase the money flow into the economy to 10 trillion dollars five additional trillion dollar came into the market who will take it companies will take it what will they do with it they will build more companies higher more people why will they do it because they are getting cheap loans now if they are getting cheap loans getting to acquire more people they think a lot when offering a right so that also happens because eventually over time using this money they can grow their business so even when Amazon a dhani type of companies might have a lot of cash reserve but if they are getting debt for cheap they will take debt for cheap and that increases the money flow that hits our GDP that hits everything so this is called as increasing liquidity okay now how does this reflect into the stock market now that's a very interesting conversation and it's killing me I can't take a look you'll find something very interesting right that for example this was 2020 this was 2020 2019 right market was at 12,200 then it fell to 8,000 so there was 40% correction 40, 45% correction then nothing happened right now in 2020 was a bad year right that was COVID first fake 2021 is when India got it with the second wave of COVID which was the most severe wave for India when in 2021 but the market went up to like cut its previous high also it's not as if that it was a very rosier atmosphere or like you know something great was happening in the economy and it kept on going up up and up right in fact 2022 was a slight correction here and it went here but if you at least COVID the impact was till 2022 okay we can say between 2020 and 2022 so if you check the levels from 12,000 we went to 18 and a half thousand right and what happened in between COVID that entire India stopped moving labor migrated from Delhi Mumbai all that to their hometowns they stopped working hardly any construction was coming up no real estate activity factories had shut down automobiles sales stopped people were sitting at home right you know consuming like Netflix or whatever but Indian market went from 12 and a half thousand to 18 and a half which is a 50% rise right so then natural question comes why did that happen the short answer in economics terms is liquidity okay and this is a very interesting statement right so I'll just make you read the statement first right so the statement is liquidity creates fundamentals fundamentals don't create liquidity people who wait too long lose money okay so now what is the meaning of that right it's called Bhethi Yunga Mehaandona right so that's like Hindi kahavat right so it simply means that see if there is more fish in the sea and if you are an amateur fisherman you will still catch a lot of fish okay but if there's no fish in the sea even if you are the most seasoned fishermen you will not catch anything okay that's a simple thing so for you to make returns from the stock market liquidity in the stock market needs to be high okay you can pick possibly the best stock out there best fundamentals best everything best this and that but if the liquidity is withdrawn from the market right for some reason then all our portfolio get will get shrunk by 50% okay but if liquidity is injected into the stock market which is called as quantitative easing right then all the stocks will go up or almost 95% of the stocks will go up to the over valuation go okay every one with me so far yeah so these are all very complicated topics to explain but I'm trying to explain it in very simple language okay now we can see this from this chart also for example if we check this and if you look at the total money printing that has happened from 2008 right so this so in 2008 total liquidity in the world right or in major economies was $4 trillion okay which is equal to the market gap of Apple now okay so $4 trillion cash pass right this was a total money that central banks had okay now by 2022 this was around $27 trillion so when net addition of 23 trillion dollars was added okay now the important question to ask is not whether stock market will go up real estate will go up this will go up that will go up at the point is that this increase in liquidity by 23 trillion dollars across the world what impact it had in the stock market so it had a very positive impact because if you study 2008 look at the nifty levels it was like maybe 4 5,000 something like this now it has gone 4x5x why because the liquidity went 4x5x so this is one and second and more important question is that see in we are sitting in 2025 now let's assume that the total outstanding balance here is like whatever like 30 trillion dollars where will VB in 2035 because if this goes from 30 trillion dollars to 60 trillion dollars R money will double but will it go from 30 trillion dollars to 15 trillion dollars and that's the question of the future okay
