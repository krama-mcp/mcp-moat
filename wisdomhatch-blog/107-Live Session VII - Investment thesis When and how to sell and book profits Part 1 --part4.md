SUMMARY:
The text discusses growth industries in India compared to GDP, highlighting sectors like credit cards and tourism as faster-growing due to higher consumer spending capacity. It contrasts these with stagnant sectors like rural economies and manufacturing, citing high costs, corruption, and lack of skilled labor as key barriers. The author shares personal experiences with bureaucratic challenges in setting up businesses (e.g., hospitality) and critiques India’s export competitiveness (e.g., Tata Motors vs. Tesla/Chinese manufacturers). The analysis extends to cyclical stocks (e.g., PSUs) and value investing, emphasizing timing and competitive advantages in global markets (e.g., China’s manufacturing efficiency).

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Growth Industries**: Sectors like fintech (credit cards) and tourism outpace GDP due to higher consumer demand, while rural economies lag due to lower purchasing power.  
- **Manufacturing Challenges**: Land costs, unskilled labor, expensive capital (high loan rates), and corruption (bribes for licenses) hinder India’s manufacturing growth.  
- **Export Competitiveness**: Indian companies (e.g., Tata Motors) struggle to compete globally (vs. Tesla, BYD) due to inefficiencies; China excels via cost-effective production.  
- **Bureaucratic Hurdles**: Setting up small businesses (e.g., resorts) faces red tape and GST burdens, discouraging job-creating ventures.  
- **Cyclical Stocks**: PSUs (e.g., NTPC, ONGC) show cyclical patterns—success depends on buying at lows and exiting at peaks, not long-term holds.  
- **Global Investing**: Diversifying into efficient markets (e.g., China, UAE) is preferred over India for export/manufacturing bets.  
- **Value Investing**: PE arbitrage opportunities (e.g., HDFC Bank) exist but require expertise; cyclical sectors demand precise timing.  
- **Geopolitical Dynamics**: Trade wars (e.g., US-China tariffs) highlight the importance of competitive supply chains and negotiation (e.g., Trump’s strategies).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
rowth industries compared to the average GDP. So it kind of if you're picking thematic themes, it kind of makes sense to pick these over something like or loan giving business. Okay. So loan giving business credit card business. So all these are themes that are growing faster than the GDP of our country. Okay. On the flip side, what is not growing rural doesn't grow that fast. Okay. And again, if you go through those 17 18 points, again, you will realize that why rural themes do not grow really fast because people have less paying capacity. Right. That's a problem. Right. Number two, what is not growing really fast, right. Manufacturing is not growing that fast. Why is manufacturing not growing? What is the primary trigger? It's a very simple thing, right. The answer is where you tell me if any of you run like a manufacturing oriented business, government not investing is not a problem. Right. What is like manufacturing manufacturing means that you take capital, okay. You take land labor and capital. These three things and you create some widget. Okay. Or you create some good out of it. Okay. Now in India land is crazy expensive because of corruption labor is unskilled. Right. This is not me saying this is generally how it is. Right. I mean the quality of anything. Right. So that's that's problem. Okay. So land is expensive labor is not skilled in capital and capital is very expensive in India capital means that if I have to set up a factory in Gwalior, right. The city I'm from. Then to get a loan, I will get a loan at 14, 15% to do that business. Now if an on top of that, get GST. Okay. So the first time I'll make like 20 like plus profits. So there is nothing left for me. So I would I like you know, sort of take that capital and best. Okay. So it makes no sense and there are bunch of other things like you know, for the corruption or rate, tape is on and you know, who's the knee and all that. I'll give you like a very simple example. Okay. So for example, people keep on asking me that you know what you're cribbing about India. This is that stuff. See, I provided like 20 jobs in go up right by setting up Airbnb's. And very simple business model. Go is a tourism state. Right. And I have a few properties there. And I'm also building a resort with my investors. I'm nothing to center. So I'm not like I'm just telling you the story. Okay. So basically that's a resort. You want to put a layer of hospitality. Now the problem is that the moment we start anything right from procuring a license to doing any construction, adding additional pool, adding additional gym. Anything that we do right we have to pay a bribes. That's how it goes. Okay. So like right from like local panchayat to everything. So that inflates the cost of doing business. And once you have set up a legitimate business, you still have to keep paying 18% GST. Okay. Now are there ways to tackle this. Yes, there are now that's a separate conversation altogether. But what I'm trying to tell you is that even to set up a business which will give like let's say 30 40 more jobs in the economy. It's a lot of pain for like small business owners. Okay. And it's not as if that I'm minting like billions out of it or like millions out of it. It's like you know decent business, which creates an additional source of income for my investors and all that. And it provides like good employment. It's a small business. These type of business exactly are the ones that actually adds jobs to the economy. Okay. It the units are not ready. Okay. And no, you'll not get any discount price. Honestly, like guys, I do like good work. And please don't ask for discounts. And so. I mean, I mean, I'm in fact, bravo right. So I mean, all of all my courses and all that right. So the point is there is no point like, you know, for example, people will people who ask for discount, they'll make things for free. And then if even if you offered for free, then they'll create like noise. Okay. So there is no point. Okay. So yeah. Okay. So any is that's on a lighter. But I hope you got the point right that. Okay. Export oriented. If you are buying any company, please always check. Can this really be competitive? So am I buying any export oriented business in India, for example, Tata Motors. Do you think that on a long term, five seven year basis, it will compete with B by D. It will compete with Tesla. We test love, I mean, you know, Trump was the mother, you know, right. He caro tariff, not my watch. Right. So then, you had to bring Tesla to India or whatever. Right. Now if Tesla starts operating in India versus like, let's say Tata Motors, now a lot of people will migrate to this kind of Tesla is able to lower its, you know, pricing or whatever. Same might happen with B by D, right. And all that right. So here you have to be competitive right classic case example that I keep giving us that she during Holy Diwali, we buy Chinese Pichkari, we buy Chinese lights. Why? And China, I don't think China celebrates the valley. The point is that whoever is the best or most competitive manufacturer by competitive manufacturer needs who can create a product at the lowest possible price by ensuring efficiency and giving a certain return on quality. Those products automatically get sold because the supply chains are very mature. Okay. So they will figure out a way to go to country X, for example, many people are believing that B by D might be banned in the US might might not be because then you are you run the entire risk. See. On the surface, it looks like that B by D will not go into the US because China because Trump will put X percent tariff. Now what do you think like China, China is not going to do anything. China will also put like a amount of tariff on some other good that the US is sending to China. So again, China and US will come at the back end and say, let's do the same thing. So then they will say, fine, okay. So then they will both drop tariffs and that's how it will go. Otherwise it's a it's a war and in a war, everyone gets destroyed. Okay. You can adopt like Kim Jong Un strategies, right, which is called as being a madman and flinging your gun in front of everyone. You know, I'm going to be new clear what I'm the one right and all that. So the world is scared and they did. Yeah, I'm not going to be a bit of a person. Right. So I'm not going to be a bit of a person. Right. So that's how they think of Kim Jong Un that he's a mad person who is slinging the gun. But what's the only card that Kim Jong Un has pressing the nuclear button right the moment he does it, he's screwed right the entire country will be new. The very next minute. Okay. So that's his only bargaining chip. Okay. So Trump is also flinging the gun, but he's not a mad person person. He's smart. Okay. He'll scare. He'll try to bring like and buy hook or croak by carat or stick approach a lot of businesses to the US. Some countries will give in to get us some kind of a thing and negotiate. Right. That of course they are going to negotiate on tariffs. But if you are going against the big wigs like China right where lot with each other. The supply chains will play and the cost comparator or the best manufacturer of a product is going to win. That's it. Okay. So that's how it goes. Okay. Therefore, like I'm putting like 10% of my bets on Chinese stock market right how do buy a Chinese stock market all that maybe I'll speak in the evening time. Okay. But 10% for me is China 5% for me right now is UAE right so these are cash rich economies. So it kind of makes sense from a global perspective and these are like my manufacturing bets. Okay. So my export bet is China not India. Okay. Why because they have already figured out systems to do it right so there is no point in experimenting. Okay. So consistent gumbounder or export this thematics. Okay. Right. Cyclical stocks now cyclical stocks are very interesting you will clearly. Really see a pattern like this happening right so for example just say and these are mostly PSU companies. Okay. So for example if you look at poll India. Okay. If you pick any right give me names random names. Okay. Like government oriented. Okay. SBI REC ONG. ONG is the way to go. HL. Varys a government company. I don't know. NTVC. Let's see. NTPC. Okay. Does this look like a cyclical chart? Yes. Yeah. It looks very cyclical. Okay. Goes up. Goes up. Goes up. It has that sign wave pattern. Okay. So it moves mostly sideways. But in this way. Okay. If you know so Paul I did not cover like a lot of things like for example the consolidation etc. Right. So I'm just quickly doing it and MBC. Okay. So NMTC. Okay. Now for example this right again like cyclical. Okay. So what you will see is now there is no harm in terms of buying cyclical companies. Right. And say any any you pick. Okay. So mostly these are like cyclical right the point is that you pick them at a good cycle. And pick them at a bottom. Okay. And here time of entry is very critical. Right. So I here pick her. And whenever you are you are starting seeing like no massive correction has happened. Here. You pick her later than it could have fallen mode. But you at least get an exit here. Okay. So to cut the long story short if you're buying on this cup pattern it kind of makes sense. Otherwise it makes no sense whatsoever. These are not buy and hold or buy and forget type of stocks. Okay. These you add later once you become slightly mature investor. Okay. Maybe you want to get set right to cyclical stocks value stocks. Here what happens is that you are buying an industry which is at a very low PE. And the PE expands subsequently. Okay. So now this is very this is getting more and more difficult to do. So I would not recommend you to talk too much about it. But there will there can be like P.E. arbitrage is right. For example, if everyone is bearish on let's say HDFC bank. Okay. From a PE point of view. So for example here you will see P.E. The P of HDFC bank fe
