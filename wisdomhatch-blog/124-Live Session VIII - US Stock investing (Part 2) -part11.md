==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text is a dialogue covering various personal finance and investment topics. The speaker discusses leveraged finance, advising against taking high-interest loans unless for distressed assets or with low rates. They critique PMS (Portfolio Management Services) in India, highlighting high fees and poor performance, and recommend index funds instead. The conversation also touches on ETF selection (focusing on low expense ratios), tax-efficient investing in the UK, and sourcing investment insights through networking. Finally, they address managing multibagger stocks by following market trends and avoiding premature sales.  

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Avoid high-interest loans** (e.g., 12.5% OD loans) unless for rare opportunities like distressed assets or with cheap rates.  
- **PMS in India is criticized** for high fees (e.g., 2% AUM, 5% profit share) and underperformance; index funds are preferred.  
- **ETFs should prioritize low expense ratios**, as major providers (e.g., Vanguard, BlackRock) are unlikely to fail.  
- **Tax arbitrage in the UK**: Selling stocks on platforms like eToro to rebuy them in tax-advantaged accounts (e.g., ISA) can save capital gains tax.  
- **Research via networking**: Real-world conversations (e.g., with fund managers, developers) provide valuable insights for investing.  
- **Multibagger stocks** require patience; sell only during downtrends and ride uptrends long-term.  
- **Career advice for CFAs**: Start in equity research, transition to hedge funds, and use tools like Bloomberg Terminal for analysis.  
- **Market downturns**: Focus on fundamentals (see the speakerâ€™s video for recession strategies) rather than reacting to fear or budgets.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ow i am a saltee person working in the mnc also i have no liability right now so but i have a OD loan of 30 lakhs so which is unusual i totally so on the interest rate of 12.5 percent so can i get some income from that amount or should i invest somewhere or what's your take on that part okay so totally unedited see i i don't know like because i do not play this game right what you're doing is that you're doing leveraged finance yeah leveraged finance is done on asset classes where the downside is very limited right so for example if you are doing leveraged finance in terms of buying real estate it kind of makes sense but if you're doing leveraged finance and doing something else then you are highly speculative and you're a gambler tendency you are right so i cannot i do not have any advice for you right on that right so there's not my area of expertise right so you have to talk to a professional gambler right so i mean that's the right bit right from that angle okay i didn't mean to offend right but this is how it is right and people who gamble in the stock market by taking loans plans to know so so so so did i want to say so i have not taken for this for the to invest in the stock market and all i said i have no liability i'm doing my job okay so no you shouldn't that but that is the spare from the last one year with me that amount so so i have taken as a backup plan so not in a mind key i will invest in the stock market on that 12.5 i'm not paying it's a OD it's a OD when i i will use then i will pay right no there is no interest rate i'm paying on it it's a celred OD plan to complicate for me to understand one so i don't know like and if you're paying went for 12.5 so basically i'm paying nothing i'm paying nothing right now if the person using it one like then i will pay interest on one like rupees one like 12.5 right yeah so paying 12.5 interest does not make sense okay so you should not do that okay okay 12.5 interest is way too high it means that if you're borrowing money then you have to generate like at least 14% that's almost market return it doesn't make sense right yeah if there is no need don't do it the only reason why you should be taking a loan is if you're getting to buy really distressed assets for example if there is a 20 20 covid crash 2008 crash makes sense or the second scenario when you should be taking a loan is that you're getting really cheap rate of interest okay otherwise there is no reason to take loans okay got it thank you danish rushikish yeah so yeah i just i want to say that thank you very much for the source and for the earnings yeah thank you to say danish be the yeah hi actually i have two questions the first is related to the us index funds as edf currently the only criteria i do is you are using the low expense ratio but any other criteria to be considered because you have vanguard so the likes of many edf's so how do you shortlist so etf you just go by expense ratio because etf's are safe right so it's not as if that blackrock etf is going to go like you know bankrupt or something of that sort so that that doesn't really happen also expense ratio just token buy all right and second question is so i'm a UK tax resident and back in 2022 at about some us stocks at a good price actually a great price amazon aimed at google etc but back then i had used eto roe which has capital gains applicable or now in the uk we have something called as a stocks and shares i-sir which means for any investment up to 20k gbp we don't have to pay any capital gains tax in the future so and it's kind of time sensitive right now some of my question is now still i'm sitting on let's say a decent game so would it be a good arbitrage strategy to be selling my etoro stocks and then buying the same under because right of the market is corrected for example google to buy and other type the the i-sir comes make sense yeah you should do that okay thanks thanks no problem okay so jith yes actually thank you so much so this action reference to you suggesting that you can gradually upgrade from index funds to cloud stocks to meet cash to small cash so i have been investing in the stocks for about 8-9 years and but primarily it has been to the pms so one of the pms is that i have it basically charges 5% on the profit that's 5% of the profit yeah so do you think that's good enough or do you think i should see yeah see my problem with pms is that for example if you consider some of the most celebrated pms fund managers they are absolute horrid okay and like in terms of their performance now if a pms fund manager is not performing you should give them zero lee why because they are charging 2% of your eum it's absolute crying i don't know how like you know government allows this bullshit to persist right that someone charges you 2% then then destroys 10% of your wealth and you are like you know sort of re-engaging with them next year right so it's like i'm actually absolute magnet right i don't know about the performance of the pms right but honestly the slack that you should give on pms guys should be close to zero if the market that year is performing at 15% and if your pms guy cannot generate 20% pull off the funds okay which ridiculous because that's the simple point right you cannot expect people to pay 2% aum and do not read the market by even 5% it's right so that's the way you need to analyze it it sounds harsh but what this is how it is right so yeah super second question actually i would be investing in little bit in the direct stocks and but i was like primarily to the pms so they started withdrawing with the some of the pms so do you think i should again restart from the from the index funds and yes in India the market is so scammy that it's much better to invest in index funds slash mutual funds compared to pms pms are structurally bad products in India because most of the fund managers are incompetent people okay that's the simple way i will tell you why are they incompetent because they do not even travel the world their only job is to market their fund and collect money that's it right so that's the only thing that they are focused on they are not even passionate about investing right so for example if you're asking to speak about investing and give me a stage to speak for 10 hours i can speak 10 hours straight okay many one i just can't even do that right so it's just like bad i don't want to say more right it will get me in trouble but this is where we are right that pms if you clear regulations you are able to study your pms there is no focus on performance right when it comes to pms say etc so just generally avoid it right that's what i would say so now yes also when there are talks about recession in the u.s and layoffs and job cuts and all that so at that time how can we save other investments and what's your point of view is there anything like people are sometimes scared of the budget please please watch my video today right so that's literally on this topic oh haven't seen it i thought it wasn't a budget i should have been released so please watch it it will give you a lot of clarity okay thank you all right mc yes so good evening upset thank you for the course it is really amazing yeah so my question was like how do you procure like information like you know you have been ahead of the China investing curve pretty much predicted so many other things in the market it may fall in you for a very long time so where do you procure information from oh i speak with a lot of people right for example i have exposure to a tyland right so because i was buying thigh properties i got in touch with a lot of people from china who have invested in tyland i get to speak with them so my primary source of information is very raw that i get to speak with people get a front-end view i am in ua so i get to speak with a lot of like fund managers here real estate agents real estate developers so it kind of gives me like a sense go a real estate i like you know there is like literally no one to speak with so because i live there as i get like my understanding so i limit my area of expertise so my area of expertise is like four five key areas right so i just try to play well in that area right so i think speaking with people really opens up a lot of useful information okay and just to follow up on that so i just i'm about to finish my cfa so i want to do this like a full-time thing so do you think is it good to like procure like a bloomberg for myself or something do you know see bloomberg is a research terminal right so i mean you have to work with some research equity research firm right to begin start your career do that right i mean i think starting out your career as an are is not a bad option right it puts you ahead in the curve right and then subsequently try to move to hedge funds right so i mean that is where you will learn a lot of stuff right that is like blue chip kind of career right for cfs okay and one more thing but where do you analyze your u.s. stocks like that's greener for Indian stocks it's where do you analyze u.s. stock so a lot of data right pie charts is there zaks not com is there Yahoo finances there so that will give you raw information and then publicity they're simply used okay thank you yeah content basil yeah so so one more question I'll show this it's about multibagos so basically see suppose we hold multibagos for a long time maybe typical patterns that we are we might use for selling the stocks might not apply to multibagos because we are really expecting them to grow multi-fold so how to apply the logic in terms of selling multibagos same exactly right so if they go into a downtrend you sell some of it if they are in an uptrend then you keep your investments alive you ride the wave so multibagos also behave exactly in the same fashion that any other stock works right so it's just that that you have to ride the wave for a very long period of time and do not get enticed sell to
