SUMMARY:
**  
The text is an informal discussion covering various investment strategies, including equity investing, Bitcoin (BTC), real estate, and tax loss harvesting. The speaker emphasizes the importance of stable cash flow, capital rotation, and avoiding highly regulated funds like Flexi-cap due to limited control. They explain tax loss harvesting as a method to offset capital gains by selling losing assets. Additional topics include stock selection, gold investment, real estate preferences (e.g., South Goa), portfolio diversification, and advice for beginners (starting with index funds). The speaker also touches on market timing, profit booking, and sector-specific cautions (e.g., oil and gas).

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Focus on Equity + BTC + Real Estate**: Prioritize equity investing for growth, Bitcoin as an alternative asset, and real estate for stable cash flow or rent savings.  
- **Tax Loss Harvesting**: Sell underperforming assets to offset capital gains taxes, deferring (not eliminating) tax liabilities.  
- **Avoid Flexi-Cap Funds**: They limit control over capital rotation; better suited for passive investors.  
- **Real Estate Strategy**: Prefer South Goa for appreciation; consider residential plots or city apartments for self-use.  
- **Beginner Advice**: Start with index funds, progress to large/mid/small caps, then learn swing trading.  
- **Gold Investment**: Buy physical gold from trusted jewelers rather than complex financial products.  
- **Market Mindset**: Accept that 90% of stock movements are unpredictable; focus on executing the 10% you understand.  
- **Profit Booking**: Regularly take profits during all-time highs to manage risk in overvalued markets.  
- **Sector Caution**: Avoid capital-intensive sectors like oil/gas unless valuations are favorable.  
- **Learning Approach**: Quality of study (2â€“3 hours/week) matters more than quantity for investing knowledge.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
Anyways, happen like 3, 4 percent. So it doesn't just doesn't add up like an taxation is high on bonds. Why would you pick it? Right. So, um, therefore, like, I mean, if if I were in a job, right, what I would primarily focus on is equity investing. Right. I'll put like major money for growth there. Equity investing plus BTC. Right. And by real estate at some point, which either helps me save my rent or which gives me an additional stable cash flow because stable cash flow causes funders on. Right. For example, the market is at a 30 percent discount and you have stable cash flow coming in. Then you get to buy the market also 30 percent discount. Right. So that's the idea of stable cash flow. Okay. Okay. You cannot estimate where FI am and you will flow. Okay. That's always up for a bit. Um, this I've sent. Okay. Will you do tax laws harvesting seed? Tax laws harvesting guy. It's a very simple concept. For example, let's say that this year, you booked a 10 lakh rupees of profit. Now, as per 12 and let's say this was long term. Okay. Now, I now how much tax do you need to pay roughly speaking? Like, I mean, not adjusting for anything. You will have to pay 1.25 lakhs. It's just 12.5 percent. Okay. On that 10 lakh. Now, let's say you don't want to pay this 1.25 lakhs. What can you do? So take a look at your portfolio tomorrow. Everything that is at a loss. Just sell it tomorrow. Okay. And then buy it after. So that way you have booked the losses. So that 1.25 lakh tax liability gets offset from everything at loss that you're selling. Okay. That's it. So have you saved it access? No. You have deferred taxes and tax deferment is a type of a tax saving only. Okay. So yeah, if Lexi Vexi kept many, Artha, Bikar, things, all that. So like, I mean, it's not going to get me done. See, the problem with Flexi cap and all that is that it's very difficult to exit. And on what basis will you exit? On what basis will you rotate capital on it? On what basis will you top up? So you have no control over your money. Now, it's great for people who have no understanding of finance or like, you know, economics or stock investing. But if you understand a little bit of capital rotation and all that, and you understand you can make very good money by rotating capital, etc. For buying things cheap, then Flexi cap does not make sense, right? From that angle. The recordings will be uploaded tomorrow. Please write to us. Anath will be added to you. You will be added. And also on your registered email ID, you would have received an invite to join. So please check your spam folder once. I have sold HDFC AMC earlier. Will you do tax loss harvesting? Yes, I'm already doing everything that I have on loss. I will sell it. So I am already selling it for the last one and a half months. How to read 200 days? This I will tell you. This is like one more technical concept that I'll cover 250, 100. Approx how many stocks at least 20 stocks should be there? You have to check your own. What about trailing, stop loss and all that. Just simple stop loss I have told because that's for investing. If you go to like trading, the goal of this course is not to make you trade us. Taking codec as an example, while there is no margin of safety, no, there is margin of safety because there has been a five year time correction. So you are buying a five year time correction that is your margin of safety. Your NNI community just check our website. I'm also lazy to post all this stuff. But otherwise I'll drop a note on like WhatsApp community. Since you guys are existing students, we'll offer some discount on an issue. His finance talk still undervalued depends on which type of finance talks it looks to me that they are. For this financial year, yes, you should book a loss right now for capital gains offsetting perspective. So that's tax loss harvesting. So do that and buy it again because you should not like exit something like codec, mind, and you know all that because they are at good value. So why I necessarily sell it. Best way to buy gold in India. See, buy 10 grams gold from reliable jewelers. That's what I would say. These new age companies, bourbon cash and prices go up are they good for long term investors or short term. What other option do you have? Like I mean in 20, 25, you have to bet on modern companies. So like I mean it sounds great that you will invest in like you know whatever maruti etc and stable businesses, but businesses themselves are becoming tech oriented. So they will burn a lot of money. So there is nothing wrong in that right. I mean every company is burning money now right. We sometimes get surprised by selecting stock with growth demand and price and time correction. Still why that stock doesn't work. See, like I mean honestly in the stock market, 90% of the things you would not know even I would not know. The idea is that whatever 10% we understand, we are able to execute in that sphere. So it's about understanding our game and playing it well. Right. So for example, travel to a bit knows that he's a very good defensive player. So I mean he's always he understands it. He can't take it. But I'm not. Right. So that's what we are also trying to do. Since gold isn't an ultimate is that you could step down and say, huh, you can do that. Right. Where is an ultimate exit investors point of view? Like you mentioned about capital rotation. That's a 50% amount is still invested. What do you mean by ultimate exit for investors point of view? I didn't get it. ETF and index fund index fund is for example, nifty 50s and index. Okay. If you buy it like a stock, it's exchange-rated fund. So you can buy it on kite by zero. But if you buy it in a mutual fund format, you can buy it on coin by zero. That right. So index is nifty 50, but you can buy it easier in a stock format or a fund or a mutual fund format. No major difference between that. NBC which provides loan on securities, right. You can see any loan business is doing well. It's just that don't buy it at very crazy valuation. In current scenario, do a step up SIP. Right. Farma is good. I mean, I commented on it in the morning time. Right. That it's complicated for me to understand. I'll not comment too much. Right. But generally it is considered to be good. I am rather betting on healthcare, insurance stocks. Right. Will you show us your portfolio from a regulation perspective? I can't. I'm happy to show you like my US portfolio, not an issue. India portfolio, I have made a public video. So I cannot like enough, for example, on my course, I can't reveal my portfolio because then it becomes and I have taken money and showed you my portfolio, which I can't do. Okay. But my portfolio, for example, if you just search, access, reverse the portfolio after 15% market correction, I have revealed parts of my portfolio and you can see my entire profit and loss and all that. When you search as buying land, do you also say, is it buying flattened? Goa. Yes. Right. So I mean, I feel that Goa is a good market. South Goa. Right. Not not. Goa. I've never purchased anything in North Goa. South Goa market is already going up. Right. It's a very good market. Right. And that's what I leave at its a conversation for another day. Okay. Momentum, momentum, something other in the last one and a half years, jitta, the momentum, and the best of all got lost. Right. So there's no point. Okay. So what is the difference between this? I've already explained how to pick real estate. I'll try right which asset class did you start with? I started with mutual funds. Right. Like almost all of you. Right. So that's where you started. Which asset class should beginners focus on index investing. Right. So in where beginners should start with index investing, then go to large cap, then go to mid and small caps, then learn swing trading, rotate capital, etc. HFN I'm not taking money as of now. Right. My crown was already closed a few months back. Right. So when I open it up again, I'll definitely inform you guys. Yes. Yes. In. Okay. So yearly rent is 3.5 cents. I'll buy apartment in city where I work for self-occupation. See, I mean, it's it's a I don't want to give like a quick answer. There are a lot of new ones. I make a lot of real estate oriented videos. Please watch it. You will get more knowledge around it. minimum amount of investment. I've first time invested in foreign country. Okay. It depends on the foreign country. For example, if you're buying something in Bangkok, you can buy our decent apartment at one crore. If you buy it in Dubai, minimum ticket size would be at least two crores. How many hours per week should be study stocks? It's not a number of hours. It's basically like, you know, how, yeah, it's not about number of hours. Okay. So like, we basically have to like, the quality is more important. The quality of content that you need, etc. But if you're doing like, maybe two, three hours a week, that's more than enough, I would say. How much EHGR is good from a defensive investing? I think anytime you're growing your portfolio, I'm more than 12, 13%, 14%, it's you're doing a good job. Okay. How do we know that we reached? We don't know. Like, so something which is in a bubble can remain in bubble for a very long period of time. Therefore, regular profit booking is critical. Right. So taking some money of the table when we are at an all time high, etc. is critical. If it goes even higher, then you take more money. If it goes even higher and makes you very uncomfortable, then you sell. Do you suggest buying land like residential plots? Yes. Yeah. How long or short time is a factor? Do you rotate? If you're just buying, you rotate. Right. You buy a support cell resistance. Okay. How many stocks at least 20 oil and gas? No. Right. Generally no. It's bad. Okay. So it's very capital intensive. Right. Okay. Yeah. Good. Prith. Shikha. Conjun. Yeah. Hi, I've got busy first of all. And the second thing for tax law harvesting, I ha
