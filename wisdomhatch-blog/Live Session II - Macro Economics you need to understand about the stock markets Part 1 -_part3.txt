==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text discusses the dominance of the US dollar and bond market as a global store of wealth, contrasting it with the weaker position of currencies like the Indian rupee (INR) in international trade. It highlights how countries like China historically settled trade in US dollars due to its stability and global acceptance. The author critiques India's economic challenges, including an opaque real estate market, a weakened bond market (partly due to demonetization), and sluggish manufacturing growth. They argue that India's growth potential lies in tourism and its stock market, but caution against the risks of lax IPO regulations and overvalued companies, which harm retail investors.  

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **US Dollar Dominance**: The US dollar remains the primary global reserve currency, backed by a strong bond market and trust in US government promises.  
- **Weak INR Acceptance**: The Indian rupee faces significant depreciation and low acceptance in international markets (e.g., Southeast Asia, Turkey), reflecting its lack of global strength.  
- **Trade Settlements**: Most countries prefer US dollars for trade settlements, though some (like India and China) are exploring alternatives like gold.  
- **India's Economic Challenges**:  
  - **Bond Market Decline**: Demonetization eroded trust in India's bond market, deterring foreign investment.  
  - **Real Estate Opacity**: Lack of transparency makes real estate unattractive to foreign capital.  
  - **Manufacturing Stagnation**: High real estate costs and low growth (2â€“3%) hinder competitiveness.  
- **Growth Opportunities**: Tourism and the stock market are viable avenues for India, but:  
  - **IPO Risks**: Lax regulations allow overvalued, unprofitable companies to go public, harming retail investors (e.g., Ola Electric, Nykaa).  
  - **Misaligned Incentives**: Mutual funds often invest in overhyped IPOs, passing risks to retail investors via SIPs.  
- **Global Context**: The US dollar's decline will be gradual, but its current dominance supports the strength of US financial markets.  

### Additional Notes:  
- The text blends macroeconomic analysis with criticism of India's policy decisions (e.g., demonetization) and market practices.  
- The author emphasizes the importance of trust in financial systems and warns against short-term speculative trends in equity markets.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
te is gone. Right? What about like what's other like bond market? Right? So bond market is another way. For example, US has a massive bond market. Right? Now what is the meaning of bond market bond market means that are that becomes a store of wealth for other nations for example, if you take iron or right if you're traveling to Southeast Asia or Turkey, right, Turkey. If you go to Turkey, right? And if you're trying to exchange INR into Turkish lira, right? You will get some some really weird rate. Okay? There will be at least 30% depreciation on that rate on INR. Okay? So Google, I'll go, but I got you it's like one Turkish lira is like 10 rupees, but you will only get like seven rupees for it. This is something like this will happen. Right? But if you and same like go to Cambodia, right, they accept US dollars, but they don't accept INR. Right? And if you try to change your INR into US dollar there, you will get a horrible rate. Okay? So that's applicable across Southeast Asia, wherever you go, Thailand, Vietnam, all that stuff. The point being that it indicates the strength of the currency. Now, you guys can look up the exact numbers. Right? But if US stock market is this much, US debt market is this much. Okay? Which means what? For example, right? Between like 2002, all the way till 2015 China, what it used to do was that it used to send a lot of stuff export to the US. Okay? So let's say that it did 100 billion dollars of export each year. And US also used to send some stuff to the US. US also used to send some stuff to China. It used to send 50 billion dollars. Well, let's say 41 billion dollars. Okay? So the net deficit is 49 billion dollars. Okay? Now this is called as trade settlement. Now 49 billion dollars of trade has to be settled. Now China can ask US, you see boss, pay me in like US dollar. Right? Or pay me in Chinese Remnambi. Right? Or pay me in gold or pay me in whatever currency. I am asking. I am asking. Okay? To settle this trade. So most of the countries right now ask for US dollar. Now they have started asking gold. Right? India has also brought it to one gold and all that stuff. But in this phase, Chinese used to ask for US dollar. They don't use, they didn't use to ask for like Chinese Remnambi. Okay? Why? Because close to 70% of the world trade still happens in US dollar. The point being that right now in this phase where we are living, right? And this started happening like post 1973. Up until now, right? I don't know till when the system will exist. The store of wealth is US dollar. Okay? Store of wealth is not INR. Right? And the key implication here being that US dollar is still a very powerful currency and it will remain so for a foreseeable future. It's not the decay is has started to happen, but it will happen slowly slowly. Okay? Now coming back to the argument that I was making US bond market is very strong because of the fact that US dollar is very strong. Right? Because US dollar is what US dollar bond market is what so for example, when a treasury bill is issued or a 10 year government security by the US is issued. What is the what is it based on? It is based on the promise that hey, if I am giving $100 to the US government and US government tells me that after 10 years, I will get $110. Okay? I can be very much rest assured that in 10 years time, US government will meet its promise. Okay? Now unfortunately in India now again just wrapping up that conversation. Let's see, we have real estate, which is very opaque. We have bond market and third option is equity. Okay? So these are like three options that any country will have and fourth is maybe two services slash tourism. Okay? Or export. Okay? Service export. Okay? Now here manufacturing wise, we have the worst like you know system that is going on right now are manufacturing growth rate is 2 3% right? It's not even worth competing anymore because price of real estate in India is very high. Just not you know, we cannot manufacturing even low end products comparatively. So foreign wealth will not come from here real estate. We are not making a transparent so it can't come from here. Bond market what is happening in 2016 so a master stroke was done that in 2016 we banned our own 1000 to be known. Okay? So now if you're in if you are a brainless person right a foreigner would you how will you look at India you look at India here. And so I'm going to go to the note that demonetized right so why would you invest in bond right and that literally killed our bond market people when I wrote this post on like Twitter people got angry at me that how can you say all this. You look at the data right so why is it that small ticket bonds have been released in India now right. So that's what is happening so that's a fact right you yourself tell me that if a government can ban its own note tell me like when US governments have banned their own notes. Now Chinese government has banned its own notes. No so they don't do it right so this is the reason why because it decreases trust on your long term capability of government. So yeah so that's the no so I'm not in India absolutely not right so the problem that has happened is this right so we are bond market sucks are export market sucks right are real estate market is not sensible for foreigners. India's if India truly needs to grow it needs to bring in tourism right which is a very low hanging fruit for it it can actually bring a lot of to money from tourism if it improves that's one area and second is stock market. So then comes a natural question that why do stock market may why is it that people get so excited about Indian stock market. So the answer is there is very simple for example if you go back to the 2000 and 9 to 2017 the interest rates were 0.25 I had shown you in the morning class now what do you think these when the interest rates are so low what would people do. A lot of investors high ticket investors hedge fund hedge fund that you borrow money and you invest okay so hedge funds borrow cheap point to fight okay and then they look at risk here bets okay so they are adding very low cost of borrowing so they will borrow like hundred billion dollars and they will raise something called as. Through their general partners and then they will raise a VC round okay or pick whatever you call it right so that fund is kept at 100 billion dollars they will look at India that okay India is a fast hungry nation right and so many startups can be created here let's give our money to a startup okay and we will figure out an IPO exit right so for example right I mean we will invest at a valuation of 100 units and we'll get an exit of 10,000 units very few markets in the world did that. Now if you study again you know history of corruption fully bookly can you go to me so what you would notice is that before like for example if you would have invested money in like Maruti IPO okay if you ask your dad granddad etc was time to be IPO today right 1990s 2000s etc etc what used to happen back then was that some money was left on the table for retail investors to make money that's a for example Maruti will come they genuinely need money to expand their operations they will launch their IPO IPO think you now you'll directly become like participants for example if you would have seen the movie grew right ashwara Raya Bishik Bhatranwali so in that like the room I am money had you know launched an IPO and got money for a lines okay so that was a time so that those were like old days okay then what happened was that over time like for example specially after like 2007 2008 the Indian regulators became like very lax in terms of IPO requirements for example the initial requirement of an IPO in India was that it needs to be a profitable company if it is not a profitable company you can't IPO not getting right you can search for it okay then that rule was dropped okay then there was like some other rule was brought then over time it was lagged lagged lagged lagged so up you are a key for example if you take a look at any IPO for example take a look at let's say Ola electric okay Ola electric okay so here is Ola electric okay it IPO that what here okay 91 it is here 51 okay so like how many and recovery will take how much time I don't know okay if you look at mama earth like mama earth what is the name I'm forgetting the name let's look at 197 this ATM which is actually a good company right which is not like already company it IPO here right 21 25 map as other okay so that's point okay look at like other high profile IPOs for example what's the name of Falguni Nair Falguni something you know what was the name for getting so whatever like so I hope you get the point right so Nika yes Nika right so Nika right so what's happening here right so it IPO here right 352 it's at half the valuation after four years I guess okay now this has become a common theme right who eventually pays for it you'll say you know I'm not doing IPM and we're going on the right so like I was a third investor right but no what ends up happening is that if you don't invest directly but your mutual fund managers invest indirectly okay so what ends up happening is that for example where does your SIP money goes okay it goes exactly to companies like these okay so all electric for example by people were like yelling at the top of your voice this is a made up bullshit company right or a well customer service people don't like it nothing good is happening in the company why is like mutual fund managers buying a company like 200 300 400 P which has like no clear growth prospects why because this is called as book building okay so and this tells you the reality of stock market basically what happens is that see Pelleke was there used to be like a trading pit okay for example olay electric 100 stocks are there now I am a book maker right so olay electric Bhavish will come right he'll say here I want to liquidate 100 stocks so I have shot will k
