==================================================

SUMMARY:
The speaker outlines an investment strategy focused on entering the market cautiously (initially with 50% of allocated funds) during a downturn, using the example of a $1 million portfolio. They emphasize beating the market during corrections (e.g., a 20% portfolio loss vs. a 33% market fall) and advocate for staggered investments ("position building") to capitalize on further declines. The analysis compares the Nasdaq (overvalued) and Nifty (fairly valued/undervalued), favoring the Indian market for current allocations. Key themes include risk mitigation (avoiding sideways markets), disciplined entry points, and preparing for downside scenarios (e.g., 20% falls) through portfolio construction.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Phased Entry**: Start with partial investment (e.g., 50%) to mitigate risk, adding more if the market declines further.  
- **Outperforming Benchmarks**: Measure success by comparing portfolio losses to broader market corrections (e.g., losing 20% when the market drops 33% means outperforming by 13%).  
- **Position Building**: Average down strategically by investing additional funds at predefined support levels to amplify alpha.  
- **Market Valuation**: Nasdaq is deemed overvalued (30% above historical norms), while Nifty appears fairly valued (13–14% CAGR), making India more attractive currently.  
- **Avoiding Sideways Markets**: Employ channel trading strategies in range-bound markets and wait for undervalued entry points.  
- **Risk Management**: Always plan for worst-case scenarios (e.g., 20%+ declines) and maintain liquidity to capitalize on further dips.  
- **Macro Context**: Extreme bear markets (e.g., 2007–2014) are unlikely due to macroeconomic safeguards (e.g., quantitative easing), but interest rate delays may suppress growth.  
- **Discipline Over Timing**: Focus on long-term returns (5–7 years) rather than timing absolute bottoms.  
- **Regional Preferences**: Prefer emerging markets (e.g., India) in high-inflation environments due to growth potential.

*Note*: The speaker’s approach blends tactical entry, valuation discipline, and adaptive risk management, targeting long-term outperformance.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
t, my first goal is to quickly enter with 50% money and see what happens. Now, what will happen if I let's say if I am if I have a budget of $1 million, right? So I mean, that is a portfolio that I'm creating. So I'm revealing the number also. What will happen for me is that see I invested like 500k. Okay? The market falls by another 20%. Now from the top, how much has the market corrected? This was minus 12 and this is another minus 20. So the stock market has corrected by roughly 33%. And I am at a 20% loss. So compared to the benchmark where I am, am I performing better or worse? I am performing better. Right? So I how much by 13%. And if I have a holding period of five years and all that, this is when it helps. The only way I will lose this game is that if the stock market itself becomes a secular, secularly bearish. Now, if that happens, then there are like, you know, bunch of other things. This is the only way I will lose in this game. Everyone understands. Okay? Someone asked me. And gets to 2007 to 2014 phase. Very good question. Okay? Because I feel that that's exactly where we are now. Okay? So let's look at what happened in 2007 to 2014 phase. So let's look at nifty. Nifty 50. Okay? What would have been a great strategy to invest in 2007, 2008 phase? Okay? So this is where we are. This is that phase. Right? I will zoom a little bit. Right? Here we are. Okay? Now, if you are buying here, this was stupidity. Okay? It means that you made this entire rally or you are a FOMO investor. As long as this is not happening, you have avoided mistake number one. Everyone with me. Point of entry is correct. Okay? Second is that you bought the market 15, 20% cheaper. Right? So where did you theoretically start investing? You started investing? 10% cheap. Okay? Like here. This is where we are. This is where we can say so 17, 18% are we need to share? And here we invested. Okay? So for us, this is the bottom line. Okay? Now, if we are investing minus 17% here. Okay? Now, we are ahead of the market already 17%. Okay? Okay? Okay? Okay? Okay? Okay? Now, we are ahead of the market already 17%. Everyone understands? Okay? Now, what will happen is that if it falls more and if you have the money to invest, you can always go back to the equation that he was. My portfolio loss is 20%. But the market is 37% down. I am beating the market by a lot. Okay? If my portfolio is 40%, market is at 57%. Okay? I am beating the market by a lot. Okay? Did it recover? And that's part one. Okay? Part two is called as position building. Now, position building means that see after every fall, you invest or downward average more. Okay? So for example, right? I mean, if I have to give you an example, right right now on NASDAQ, right? QQQ. How am I investing? Right? So QQQM. Then I will tell you that. How much money am I put on the roughly here? Okay? So the market is down roughly 13%. Right? The market is down roughly 13%. My portfolio is down like minus 3%. Okay? Now, this is called a support. Okay? Now, this is not blind buying. Okay? You would have seen that I have marked these orange lines. Okay? Now, this is second support. This is third support. Now, if the index falls more, then I will top it up. I will bring more money into the market. Now the market then is let's say minus 20%. But I am at minus 1.5%. So I will keep on expanding this alpha. How to do it? I will talk separately. But I hope you got the point that how exactly I am trying to avoid like a sideways market. Okay? Now this, now just to plant out the regions, right? So for example, from current levels, right? There is, I will invest another bulk at minus 5.3. Okay? And then I will invest another bulk at another 4% fall from there. Okay? So I am topping up at all these points. Okay? So I am topping up. First major top up was here. Second major top up is here. Third major top up is here. Fourth major top up is here. Right? So I will at least leave room for this. Okay? Now, it might happen that I have a budget of 1 million dollars. I might only be able to do it 750K USD. And first of all, the market is running. Now, if the market is running, then I will adopt. Bull run strategy of investing, right? That how to invest in a bull run market. Okay? Here I am investing in a market with a viewpoint of bearish run. Everyone is understanding. Okay? Key takeaway. What is the key takeaway? Right? On Monday when the market opens, you should at least do your first bulk. Okay? Whatever is IP money you have, you should do it. How much of it? At least 60, 70% you should be fully invested in a market like India. Because India is a high inflation market, right? US is a high inflation market. It can have and 2007, it was a very bad road map. That's absolute worst case what we are imagining because that was a 66% fall. That was the first round of quantitative easing. So speaking from a macroeconomics, it's unlikely that the market is going to fall by 66, 70% ever again. Okay? Like at least for a substantial future. Okay? So that's the bottom line. Now natural question comes that actually why you're not investing 100% of your money right away. If you trust the market so much, see here's the problem, right? Because I'm trying to avoid sideways movement on the market, right? And here we need to somewhat ball eyeball, right? The long term returns on the market on a five year, seven year basis. Okay? So this is 2020 pre-COVID. If I look at the market run up on pre-COVID basis, the market has run up 127, 125.78%. So on a long term basis, will I call NASDAQ overvalued or undervalued right now? I will still call it overvalued because typically NASDAQ should not give more than 90%. It is still somewhat 30% overvalued. So what I am now, do I expect like another 30% fall like this? No. What is going to happen is that it is going to go like this maybe, right? Something like this. Okay? So this is the region in which I want to invest majority of my money. Money is understanding. Okay? Market will not fall like this. This will only happen when QT happens, right? When the money is withdrawn from the system like crazy and there is negativity in the world. This government will not let it happen. Okay? What is, however, going to happen is that see, interest rate cut delays will happen that you know what we are going to cut interest rate six months down the line. So that's negative news for the market. Okay? As a result, the market will just trade in this region. Okay? What is it that I should do as a sensible investor and how will I make a very good alpha? If I'm trading this channel, this is called as channel trading strategy. This is what I am anticipating. This is my viewpoint on the market. If the market was undervalued, for example, this this region, right? Is undervalued, I would say. Why? Because see, for example, if you consider, let's say 2019, okay? To this point, 2022. Okay? So this is roughly like a 12% CAGR, which is not crazy. Okay? You understood how I got 12%. So 2020 to 2022. I'm looking at this, this part, okay? 22 or 23%. Okay? So this is 12% CAGR over two years. Here I'm looking at what? I'm looking at 123 over a period of five years. So this is more than 20% CAGR. Okay? On an average, now here you need to know the average numbers. Now what is a good rate of growth at what rate does the US economy grows? 4%, maybe like 4%, right? Okay? Nasdaq is tech. So maybe tech will grow at 10, 12%. Right? Why? Because Amazon type of companies will grow at 10, 12%. Okay? So 10, 12% is, let's monopoly, add one more point. So 13% up Malo. Now this is the base rate that I'm willing to pay. Okay? So this is what I'm eyeballing. You understand? Okay? And this is how I avoid sideways movement. So am I bearish on US stock market? Yes. Because I want US stock market to fall more. Okay? Because for me, I need to have that good time of entry and I really hope that it falls a lot. Okay? So I hope it crushes by 80% right? Then I'll make like crazy amount of money. But I can't do anything. I cannot make it fall. The only option I have is to wait sensibly. Okay? What about Indian markets? So let's do the same analysis. Okay? Nifty. Okay? Nifty. Okay? So here is Nifty. Let's do the same analysis. Right? Here we are. Okay? So in five years, right? We have grown 91%. Okay? Now, which means like what? 14%? 13%, 14%? 14%? C.H.R. Correct? C.H.R. We are not looking at the simple compounding. Compounding even compounding with A.G.R. So this will come out to be maybe like 13%, 14%. So one could say that this is fairly valued. Okay? So at this point is Indian market more undervalued or US market more undervalued? I would say Indian market. Okay? Nifty. So therefore I'm like almost fully invested in the Indian market. Not now because this green candle has formed. In fact, even check some of my post and already invested like 95% of my money came out with a post. Said it like point blank that I'm investing like 95% I'm invested. And I'm okay with it. Right? Now, so that's part one. Right? That's good point of entry. Now then comes question two that hey, what if something bad happens? Okay? How will you handle it? Okay? So that's where portfolio construction comes into the mix. Okay? That which we will talk subsequently. Right? But at every point in time, for example, right now, when I'm investing in the Indian market, I need to have a very clear plan of dealing with a 20% fall. Okay? What do I mean by 20% fall? Let's say that I'm fully invested in the Indian market. Okay? Let's say I had. Oh. I had invested. My entire portfolio hypothetically. I'm not revealing my like portfolio numbers and all that. So let's say hypothetically, I have invested 10 crores. Okay? Here. Okay? I'm fully invested. Now, the question I need to answer it because and why I've invested fully here because this is a good point of entry. Everyone understood the concept of good point of entry. Okay? Then comes question number two which I need to answer. What will I
