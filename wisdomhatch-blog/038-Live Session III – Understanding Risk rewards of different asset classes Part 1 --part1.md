SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a transcript from a live session discussing risk and rewards of different asset classes. The speaker emphasizes the importance of having a cash hedge (e.g., 20% of the portfolio) to mitigate market downturns and highlights the value of their course in building conviction for better investment decisions. They critique misleading claims about high returns (e.g., 16% from NPS) and stress the need for fact-checking data. The speaker also compares active vs. passive investing, noting most fund managers underperform index funds like Nifty 50 ETFs due to lower expense ratios and simpler structures.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Cash Hedge Strategy:** Maintain 20% cash in portfolios to capitalize on market dips (e.g., buying when markets drop 10%).  
- **Course Value:** The course aims to deepen understanding and conviction, enabling more confident investment actions.  
- **Fact-Checking:** Verify claims (e.g., NPS returns) before acting; data shows NPS returns are typically 9–12%, not 16%.  
- **Active vs. Passive Investing:** Most active fund managers fail to beat passive index funds (e.g., Nifty 50 ETFs), which have lower fees.  
- **Investment Myths:** Beware of misleading promises (e.g., inflated returns) and prioritize structural/logical analysis of financial products.  
- **Expense Ratios Matter:** Passive funds (like ETFs) often outperform due to minimal management costs compared to actively managed funds.  
- **Beginner Insight:** Understand asset class categories (large-cap, mid-cap, etc.) to make informed diversification choices.

==================================================

 Good morning everyone. I hope you can see me. Yes, we come up. Okay, awesome. We'll start like in a few seconds. Alrighty. Okay, so let's start. Nice and two important points. Right. So I like whenever I teach, I don't know what I'm going to teach. Okay. So like, honestly, I have a rough structure, but I teach every course very differently with the intent of adding value. And I bring like the latest possible information. So I was reviewing the recordings of like my last course that I've done. Okay, so I'll just show you that first. And when I done it, there are two video clips that I'll play. Right. I mean, of course, this is not like recorded. So you'll, you know, this is like recorded. So I could not have changed it. So when I've done that course, it was then if he was at almost 25,000. Okay. So and I just want you to listen to like some one to points that I had said here. And then we will start. The market is our whole time. What is the first most critical thing that you should do? You should have a 20 percent hedge or cash hedge. We are stopped by the portfolio. So for example, we can stop multiple portfolio. So we'll ask how much cash should you be assigned? We should be 10,000 for these sides. In the end, the market directs by 10 percent. This money would be, and you invest here. Okay. Let me look at this. This. Okay. This is a little bit, a cycle level. So this strategy is called a cash hedge. Now I cannot go back in time and change what I had said. Right. So I'm 100 percent stand by it. So if you have done it, you would have made like 10 percent returns already. Right. So you're up by the market by 10 percent every year and distance. Okay. So this was like one. Right. So whenever I'm teaching a course, I teach it as per today's market dynamics. So this course was started September of 20, 20, 14. Okay. So that is when the class recording was and at that point in time, my most critical suggestion was that have like 20 percent cash hedge. And this is something that I said on my public videos also on my YouTube channel membership. Also to my students also. Now you'll say that you're not to you say all these things on all platforms. So what's the point of joining a course? The point of joining a course is. Action ability right action ability means that you are able to understand the concept well and apply it more strongly instead of investing like 10 percent. You will have like maybe like 50 percent 60 percent more trust on it. So therefore you are able to put more money. Okay. So you are able to do it with conviction. That's the entire idea of spending like whatever 16 17 hours of your time that you're giving me. Okay. So the only thing that this course does is that it allows you to have more conviction. Okay. So please don't go around comparing your sharpening. You're going to be the point is that was when you are spending like 16 17 hours with me. Your conviction level will be very different compared to like someone randomly listening to my YouTube videos. Okay. So that's the idea or intent behind the course. That's point one point to is. Now you'll go around and you will try to like you know, pack check me because it's not as if that I am. I tell you something and you blindly believe in it. I also make mistakes. That's not I'm a human. I make a lot of mistakes and I'm open about it. But what ends up happening is that when you see a contrary opinion, please at least pack check it right. So for example yesterday I was getting a lot of questions around NPS right. That okay you said like you criticize like PF, PPS, PPS, NPS everything. But I heard that NPS is like 16 17 percent return or whatever right. So then I looked like you know, why is this like data coming up. So I was able to find a video okay on this topic. Okay. So for example, this is Neil Boorate right. So he has gone on to say and I'll just played out with you and then I'll fact check it. So I'll tell you how to fact check things. Okay. So this is the video or 0.2 percent less than the large cap natural fund return up 16.8 percent. Let's talk about NPS today. What are its pros and cons? First things first, what are the returns that NPS has given? So you can see the final return of NPS equity schemes, tier one equity schemes. It is 6.6 percent CGR. So here's written 16.6 okay and here he has admitted that mistake that it's 16.6. So what is he saying? Like literally fact based that large cap tier one equity based NPS has given 16.6. So let's fact check this okay. So here you go. You literally ask tier one NPS large cap equity. Returns. So this is between 9 to 12. Okay. So the returns of NPS large cap equity investments have ranged from 9 to 12 percent over the long term. Right. So this is blatant like that's 0.1. So I can't debate with someone 16 percent. So where did this 16 percent number come from? Okay. So then comes that okay, there are some schemes. For example, there is UTI right NPS tier one returns. Okay. This would be equity. I'll just check. Okay. So this was around 16. Right. So you some Mila Miluke. If you look at your CGR will comes out to be 16. Okay. So if you look at this particular NPS. I mean NPS like mutual funds. There are varied options. It's like me saying that you know what? If you would have that mutual funds give like 25 percent CGR large cap because quant mutual fund gives 25 percent CGR large cap. Okay. And then a FOMO will be created. You will start doubting. Yeah. So be a cookers. Okay. Right. I mean how can it be that's part one part two is that structurally see things. So fact checking these days idiots is very easy. Okay. So I'll just like point blanks it check me also. There will be a lot of mistake that I might make. Okay. But fact check it. This is your money at the end of the day. Second more structurally speaking. You have to understand the fact that why would someone give you additional returns for example if mutual funds large cap typically gives a CGR of let's say index gives you like 13 percent on an average CGR. What is it that these NPS guys are doing that they will be able to give you 16 percent you tell me and that to tax the. They might be investing in more risk here assets. So therefore you are getting 16 percent. Now NPS pension scheme do you really think that they will invest in more risk here assets. No, okay, they can't right by mandate they can't okay so even structurally logically if you think this is pure blatant lie unnecessary foremost created right now I don't have time to like you know sort of. And you know keeping bringing and fight with people and all that I'm just telling you that you might find contrary data please fact check it because at the end of the day you have to make a decision whether you're putting on money pdf e ppp Because I said you they could upload you know like shot taught like something wrong in our class that he was used to criticize like NPS NPS I'm waiting 16.5 percent tax free returns by check to go. Right I'm average is 9 to 12. Okay, so that's the. That's the basic point NPS doesn't have lower expense ratio than nifty 50 for example if you buy nip on these nifty 50 with NPS have lower expense ratio or would nifty 50 ETF will have the lowest expense ratio I would say nifty 50 ETF you can check. Okay, so why because there is no fund manager or large team require to mirror on if 50 50 ETF okay pension funds still require like on office a team to figure out where to invest they are spending money on salary. They have to do to go to go to get it from you so the point being that you know please don't like at least fact check everything just because someone is making like a shiny video don't just believe in like 16% Bully NPS and point of line Clier right I mean that's what I'll say you can literally like fact check it. So anyways the reason why I had to bring it up is that because then people start doubting you check whatever you taught it like last one it was wrong right so therefore I'm saying that you have to fact check all these things and it's not as if that I'm making up this data or I control ML. These days it's very easy to check everyone right what what they are saying okay say pure large gap funds when typically give you right see I'll tell you like basic common sense okay it's not even like you know it's very basic right for example when you go with an active mutual fund. You have to pay a manager okay and his team to scout and hunt for stocks they will charge you an expense ratio. Right I'll talk about it in like a little half of today right more right and if you are investing in index for example someone asked me or yesterday you guys were asking me that how to invest in nifty 50 ETF or mutual funds so all you do is that you buy something called as nifty bees. Okay so you buy nifty bees from your zero the car eat account or whatever here there is no manager or large team required so therefore expense ratio is low right that's the simple point okay so therefore like I mean and typically like I mean it is all data tells us that 85% of fund managers do not beat passive mutual funds even Mr Warren profit put a bet there is a very famous story that you were saying that you know what like I mean I'll give one million. To mutual fund managers who consistently beat the index and there was no one was able to win that bit okay so that's a simple point okay. A myth here is that see not there are an important point for you to know as a beginner is that see you know there are different types of mutual fund for example there are 4000 plus mutual funds in the market okay now and this can be largely categorized into index okay large cap mid cap so that's a big. Mid cap small cap sectoral okay and international so these are like five major category types and literally we don't
