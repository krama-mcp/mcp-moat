SUMMARY:
The text provides investment advice focusing on two main types of stocks: **consistent compounded companies** (e.g., Hindustan Unilever) and **thematic investments** (e.g., tech or finance sectors). For consistent stocks, the speaker recommends buying below the 200-day moving average (DMA) to minimize downside risk and capitalize on rebounds. Thematic investing involves identifying industries growing faster than GDP (e.g., AMCs, hospitals, banks) and avoiding slower-growth sectors. The speaker cautions against outdated strategies, overvaluation, and greed-driven bets, emphasizing research, discipline (e.g., 5% max allocation per stock), and macro-level analysis.  

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Consistent Compounded Stocks**: Buy mature companies (e.g., Hindustan Unilever) below their 200 DMA for reduced risk and potential upside. Historical data shows these stocks often rebound after touching the 200 DMA.  
- **Risk Management**: Limit individual stock exposure to 5% of your portfolio. Start with 50–60% of intended capital to leave room for adjustments.  
- **Thematic Investing**: Focus on industries growing faster than GDP (e.g., tech, banking) and leverage sector expertise (e.g., tech trends like AI). Avoid slower-growth sectors unless for speculative, high-risk bets.  
- **Avoid Overvaluation**: Do not buy well-known "blue-chip" stocks (e.g., HDFC Bank, Nestlé) at inflated prices.  
- **Macro Perspective**: Align investments with GDP growth rates; prioritize sectors with expansion potential.  
- **Critique of Outdated Strategies**: Warns against relying on historical legends (e.g., early investors in Indian markets) or outdated books (e.g., *Intelligent Investor*) without adapting to modern, tech-driven markets.  
- **Psychological Discipline**: Markets are sentiment-driven; avoid greed and focus on sustainable, research-backed strategies.  
- **Practical Example**: Screener tools can visualize 200 DMA trends to identify entry/exit points (e.g., buying at consolidation phases, selling at resistance levels).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ited. Right. Yeah. Actually, like in credit money. So we also invest like right now. Okay. So this is exactly the fourth pillar that I was speaking about like you have for inner engineering work or all that. So this you have to calm down your nerves. Okay. So you have to make decisions as per where you are right in your career. Okay. Okay. So awesome. So I hope that this is clear. Right. At least the context is clear to everyone. Now the moment you go to like individual stocks, where do we start? Okay. So I would recommend that you start with consistent compounded type of companies. The easiest way to buy them is to buy under 200 day moving average. Okay. This is what now what yesterday I'd explain you right and I've shown you a few examples for example, let's go on screener. How do you apply 200 day moving average? So what are consistent stocks right where the business model is very clear. For example, Hindustan Unilever's business model is very, very clear. It's a mature company. You're buying a mature company. Okay. And here all you have to do is that for example, look at how the stock typically behaves. Click click on this max. This black line is called as 200 DMA. Okay. So I'm just clicking this. You will see this 200 day moving average line and you can study the last 20 30 years data of the company. You will always see that company touches this bounces up touches this bounces up. Sometimes you get opportunities to buy it below 200 DMA. For example, here, here, here, here, here, here, here, here and here. Okay. So here it is consolidating this stock. Okay. So therefore you are buying a time correction also you are buying it below 200 DMA also. Will you make like what is the downside of these this investing you will it's unlikely that you will see another 15% drop on this stock. And there is a very good chance that it will hit its previous peak. So for example, what was the previous peak. This is like maybe like 2100. And this is almost 3000. So you trade this rate. So for example, if you see a channel for me or something like so for example, this is the first. Resistance point. Okay. So what technical be they can have a day. I'm not I'm just sort of fleet telling you just to save time. So this becomes. Like your exit point. So this is like maybe 20% it's a part survey of profit. But I'll just be up right. So this is something that will give you confidence also. So this is where you start your individual investing. Okay. Whenever you are looking after consistent compounded type of companies. Now only primary mistake that you can make is what that you buy them over valued as long as you're not buying HDFC bank Asian paints. Bajaj finance. It you will Nestle type of companies. TCS all these companies at an over valued price you will be fine. Okay. Now am I saying that invest all your Jama Pungji in like you know, Hindustan universe absolutely not maximum limit always applies on individual assets, which is 5%. Okay. How much can you invest right now you can start with 50% capital but leave room for now. Okay. So for example, and this is ballpark. Now I cannot give you like a golden rule that you can all do it in like four tranches and all that stuff. Not always. Right now it is quite discounted. So I will say that do like 50% 60% of whatever intended capital is. For example, if you are portfolio is let's say one crore. 5 lakhs is the maximum capital that should go on individual stock. So 5 lakhs or 60% is 3 lakhs. So 3 lakhs you can put tomorrow. Okay. If you feel like right. So this is clear to everyone. Okay. So these are consistent compounded stocks. You can easily buy them not an issue. Okay. Then comes second type of stocks which you should and I'll just highlight this whatever I'm covering. Okay. So this is one that we are coming to. Now then comes. So that's all the time. Yeah, then comes the second type of stocks which are thematic in investing now thematic investing is also very easy to understand for example you work in IT jobs right hand for example hypothetically or you work in manufacturing. Whichever industry you are in or wherever you are doing a job you will understand at least that industry for example, let's say that you're in software. What trends do you see you will see that you can number one. Large language models are picking up and a lot of automation will happen even when it comes to coding. Okay. So a lot of software jobs are going to decline, especially back and software jobs. If you are building LLMs. If you are building like commercial applications of AI then maybe like developers will pick up or maybe developers will go on Web 3.2 and all that right. So you understand like all these intricacies of that particular industry. So which theme are you picking you are picking tech theme. Okay. Now let's say that you also want to study like finance theme. Now is this your area of expertise. No right. Will you be able to understand housing finance companies AMC hospitals all that stuff. No. Okay. You have to basically make like macro investments. What is the easiest way of macro investing very simple. This is your GDP growth rate. Let's say it is at 6.5%. What do you need to do? You need to pick industries which are growing faster than the GDP. Okay. Just avoid companies which grow. Lower than the GDP. Right. For example, 2.5% is manufacturing. Lugge a broad of manufacturing manufacturing and make an India this scale India. I think I've planted a lot of makeup. I've just got void all that nonsense. Okay. If the industry itself is not growing faster than the GDP. It's better to just buy 50.15. That's like common sense. Okay. Why would you even get into all that PS off like you know identify like small manufacturer and all that stuff. Okay. Why would you get into all that nonsense is because you are greedy. Okay. So you want to double your triple your money 5x your money and like dumb companies can you actually 5x 10x your money in such companies. Yes. Right. I mean, took the job. I'm not saying that right. But generally as a system you can't invest if you're figuring out a system that you can this is something that I'll teach my kids or I want to build a portfolio for 60 70 years. You can't do that as a system. You can't keep on like going and exploring like slower than GDP growth companies and figuring out like hidden gems there. It's impossible to do it. Okay. Lower a book. Right. You know diamonds in the dust and Waggara Waggara and portfolio. Right. So the point is that even book writers who have met like 50 like founders and all that to write those books. The themselves are not able to beat like fine like hidden gems. So how will you do it? Okay. Answer is you will not. Okay. Now. Right. He's like, you know, grown is portfolio from 50 to 500 by dad. As I'm the same. Right. So there's no point. Right. For example, when Mr. Akish Dunjian, while I started investing in 1990s. Indian index was close to nothing. Right. Now in 2025 the market is fairly mature. Now if something is already big, it's like you buying Apple earthly. Okay. And Apple computers early you buying Bitcoin in 2016. You buying like, you know, whatever Solana very early you buy. Mattik is very early. So if you're early, you buy Dubai real estate in like 2009. Okay. If you're early, any game, of course you're going to make money right and you will become a legend in that right. So Mr. Akish Dunjian, Wala Radha Krishna, Mani Ram Dev Agrawal, all these people actually made their wealth. Not because there's some excellent stock because they made their wealth because they started that asset class very early. So you're getting it. I'm not missing on them. Okay. I'm just telling you a reality. Okay. So their investment strategy. Do not apply today. That's how I'll simply say if you don't trust me, there is a book. It's called Intelligent Investor. Please go and order it. Right. And read it. Okay. And then you tell me like what did you understand from it. And you'll go to sleep after reading like 15 20 pages. It's written by Benjamin Graham, who is the founder of like CFA Institute. Right. So very good book. So the applications, the things do not apply anymore. Okay. So you can read it. Right. I mean, there's no, it's a good academic book to read. Right. But practically investing has changed quite a lot. Right. So the principles that you will learn there because think about it this way when that book was written, we had factory model of running things. And you will for a business to scale, they had to put physical factories post 2000 to scale a business. You require a tech. So that has been the fundamental shift in the business landscape to begin with. Right. So I'm not again criticizing any book. I'm just telling you the reality. Right. Of what's what's happening. If you read outdated material, it will kind of you can definitely pick some points from there. I'm not like you know, sort of saying that you will not learn anything, but the point is that it's not relevant. Right. So similarly, like do not get swayed by what people are saying. Now it's a research oriented research driven market. Mostly psychologically and sentimentally driven. Okay. So that's where you need to start thinking a little bit. Okay. So I hope that this point is clear that thematic investing. You can start learning. Right. I will share some points on wisdom, hatch community, etc, etc. And now you will learn more. But here the first key common sense, I call trick. And again, you don't need to trust my word. Right. I'm just speaking like, you know, from a from an information giving perspective. Let's see, according to me, something like AMC's hospitals, banks in India are going to grow faster than GDP. That has happened in the past. And this will continue to happen for a foreseeable future. Now if for some reason, India's GDP starts to shrink or if India's GDP goes on a poor path. Okay. Then will I be exiting this? Yes. Okay. But as of now, these are faster g
