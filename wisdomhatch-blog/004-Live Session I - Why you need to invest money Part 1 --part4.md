SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses sustainable investing and personal finance strategies, emphasizing the importance of aligning investments with individual risk profiles and long-term goals. It highlights key concepts like tax-efficient investing, asset class diversification, and the role of fixed deposits (FDs) as "iterative capital" for financial security. The speaker explores the trade-offs between risk and return in different asset classes (e.g., large caps vs. small caps) and stresses the need to seize opportunities, such as distressed sales, while being mindful of ethical dilemmas. The session also touches on tax residency strategies (e.g., moving to tax-friendly jurisdictions like UAE) to optimize capital gains.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
1. **Personalized Investing:** Tailor your investment strategy to your risk profile, life goals, and financial situation—avoid broad mistakes and maximize opportunities.  
2. **Tax Efficiency:** Plan for long-term capital gains (LTCG) taxes; consider tax residency changes (e.g., UAE/Singapore) to minimize liabilities when booking profits.  
3. **Asset Class Diversification:** Understand risk-return trade-offs (e.g., FDs offer safety but negative real returns in high-inflation India; equities like Nifty 50/small caps offer higher growth but higher risk).  
4. **Rule of 72:** Use this to estimate doubling time for investments (e.g., Nifty 50 doubles in ~6 years at 12.5% returns; small caps in ~3.5 years at 21%).  
5. **Iterative Capital:** FDs serve as a safety net for unstable income (e.g., entrepreneurs need 3 years’ expenses; secure jobs may need less).  
6. **Opportunistic Investing:** Profit from market dislocations (e.g., distressed property sales) but acknowledge ethical complexities (e.g., tobacco investments).  
7. **Macro Perspective:** Focus on systemic wealth growth (sustainable returns over time) rather than sporadic high-risk wins.  
8. **Geographic Arbitrage:** Leverage global tax structures (e.g., UAE’s 0% LTCG) for higher after-tax returns.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
this sustainable investing method is designed as per you this is not designed as per me I'm holding on our sector system is this you also copy that no that's not the point the point is that you learn from me and then you given your risk profile given your understanding what you want from life etc etc you mitigate or you don't make broad mistakes you maximize on opportunities and create a system that you are happy with every one with me so far cool awesome so these are like some basics of personal finance that I will tell you right and now let's deep dive into the course right and the first session that we are going to complete today is around so before I will be doing a little bit of discussion I've already done on this right how can you grow your wealth sustainably that if you develop a system okay it's not about like you know figuring out like one year you made like 1000% returns and then you did not invest like you know for five years and the net worth on which you made that 1000% return was only 0.5% of your boat for your big small sense okay uh third key question is that what if you attack 30% LTCG by the time you retire now do you have a plan okay this is a genuine concern which no one which no one is telling you to think about but I would highly encourage you to think about because even if like I mean for example you put like let's say one crore in the market right now it grows to like 40 crores and at the end of that this hypothetically you have to pay like 50% LTCG you know it makes no sense so therefore figuring out this third equation is also very important as and when you're portfolio grows okay now many of you would jump to conclusion that should we stop investing in India the short answer is no okay you should invest in India because there is a way to structure this as long as you're not booking capital gains okay so for example technically you can invest in India right now okay or like in US right right now like at least US much a legais system right and then you like let's say that you're investing from 20 years to 50 years okay and you're not booking any profits per se because here if you book profits as an Indian tax resident you will have to pay taxes in India which again is subjected to 12.5% LTCG and it's 20% or 12.5 I'll double check okay for international investing but if for example if you're investing between 20 to 50 years and you have a big portfolio then technically right as per today's rule you can become like a UAE tax resident or whichever country that taxes or Singapore tax resident and then you can book profits and bring that money to UAE right and then there you don't have to pay any LTCs okay so this is like a rule okay so maybe I'll explain it if we get the time subsequently okay so the macro concepts so this is the macro class and we will study like 67 concepts right which I'll take you through and the first key concept that we will study is something called as asset class diversification this is a very important concept right very simple but very important right and basically what it says is without boring you with too much details that for example if you're doing fixed deposits now here the risk is low and the return is also low okay for example if you're putting your FD money or like if you're doing like a 1 crore FD on HDFC bank you will make 7% but is this the return that you're making no because you have to look at after tax returns so how much you are paying as tax let's assume that you're on the highest tax so you'll pay 30% okay so you are effectively making like 5% after tax now what is inflation in India for you it will at least be like 89% so how much money are you losing here so you are effectively losing minus 3% now as a system if you put money in an FD you are 100% going to lose money now you'll say as I have told you I have been in influencers and this that stuff okay and is there like no utility to FD money there is utility to FD money do I do FD yes okay but there is a specific reason why I do FD money that is called as experimentation money now what is the meaning of experimentation money so for example if I have high risk job for example I'm an entrepreneur there is no guarantee that I will make money next year or the year after that or the year after that so how much money should I lock away safely without thinking about it even as investment capital really depends but I would figure out like my iterative cycle now what is the meaning of iteration cycle for example let's say that you run a small business okay your textile business you have like you know trading business or whatever it is then usually you will say that you know what boss if my business goes to zero it will take me like 3 years to build another business okay now for 3 years I don't need any headache so what should I do I should put 3 years of my expenses into a FD okay where to put it how to put it there you're not looking for growth okay yeah with G1 small finance you have to be by month grow right just do it in HDFC only it's fine right that's not the money that you're looking to grow that's your iterative cycle or experimentation cycle capital that's the utility now if you're a government job percent for example my wife was an IES officer Indian Economic Service Officer for her to lose her job right it has to go by the president of India okay so it's not as if that someone can fire her okay so for example I have you have you have a high court judge case but I will give you right now and he made like I don't know income account you're right and then 16 crore of like in a cash was I you know what discovered in his house right and now then he was like in some I don't know it's with sit which high court he was in then he was transferred to some other high court right so that was the maximum punishment right so the point is that some jobs are extremely safe okay now do you need like 3 years of capital like me right or do you do you need like 3 years of iterative capital probably know maybe you require like 3 months of that capital right everyone understand right this concept okay natural question comes at Akshath where are you doing it right see I'm now doing it in UAE because for me the if there is no loss of capital there right so for example in UAE I can do FDs at like 4.75 percent there is zero the inflation in and after tax I get 4.75 because the because the capital gains is zero okay so my after tax UAE FD returns as 4.75 and inflation in UAE is 2 percent okay so net effectively even after doing FD I can make 2.75 percent total everyone understood right so it really depends on your personal situation some of you might be in the US some of you might be in UK now again there the tax might be very high all that stuff so hard to say that all that right but if you have no other option at least just think about this entire thing from a iterative cycle capital right where are you creating FDs in UA so you do it in my bio bank right or like ADCB wherever like or there is like fab does like good rates so they are also okay so first Abu Dhabi bank so all these are good okay so you can do that right everyone with me what is the role of FDs right so this is the first asset class and here I will call it as iterative capital right this is very important then comes the second right because all of us want to grow our money right so for example if you look at large caps and India on Nifty 50 will you tag it safer or more risky compared to S&T 500 which is a US index where will you put it I'll probably put it like here okay so like almost at the same level that the return profile is also similar and risk profile is also similar what about like small caps right so small caps I'll put it here because the risk is higher right and returns are also higher now just for context Nifty 50 on an average right on a 20 year CGR basis gives around 12.5% now small caps gives around 21% right on a 20 year basis okay now to contextualize this better right please understand a rule of 72 now 72 means that how much time does it take or how many years does it take for your money to get doubled okay so take the number 72 divided by the number of return okay so this is 12.5 okay and this is what this is almost six years okay so yeah almost six years five point something years okay so roughly it takes six years to double your money in Nifty 50 right how many years does it take to double your money on an average on small caps so you divide this by 21 so this becomes what three point something years to double your money in small cap and mid caps okay so this is a difference between this and this now as retail investors we get very excited about this equation that okay if I am getting to double my money like literally half the time compared to large caps I will primarily be a small cap investor investing is about and this is the third key takeaway for the class and you only need to know town take a ways investing is about opportunity and you will only understand this if you buy realistic okay so like because that's the easiest thing to understand right now what is the meaning of opportunity for example in Bangalore this opportunity is going to come in the next two three years right a lot of people like IT workers etc like normal job doers because both husband and wife have a job they will go and take an EMI on a two-carrow house yeah which they can't like afford right now one of them might lose a job now what do you think they will do they will sell that house now that that thing is called as distressed selling right now they might even sell it below the market trade right now should you go and buy that you'll say you know I'm not going to do that I'll take someone's you know I'll seek someone's trouble as opportunities but that is what unfortunately investing is I cannot change the rules of the game people make money by investing in cigarette companies that kills people right that's how it is right and I cannot change the ru
