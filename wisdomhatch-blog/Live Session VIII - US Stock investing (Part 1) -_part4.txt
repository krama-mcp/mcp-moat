SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a conversational lecture on investing strategies, emphasizing patience, sensible opportunity-based investing, and avoiding desperation. Key points include prioritizing selling fairly valued assets over undervalued ones, the importance of market valuation (overvalued vs. fairly valued), and capital rotation. The speaker advocates for simplicity in investing, focusing on index funds and blue-chip stocks for consistent returns (12–15%), while direct equity can target higher returns (15–20%). Technical analysis, trend riding, and fundamental checks (e.g., 5–10 year performance) are highlighted for individual stocks. The speaker also discusses retirement planning, linking portfolio size to inflation-adjusted spending needs.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Patience is critical**: Wait for sensible opportunities to buy/sell; avoid impulsive decisions.  
- **Valuation matters**: Sell overvalued/fairly valued assets first; avoid undervalued ones unless necessary.  
- **Market states dictate strategy**: Reduce positions (30–40%) in overvalued markets; rotate capital in fairly valued markets.  
- **Simplicity wins**: Stick to index funds (Nifty 50, NASDAQ) for consistent 12–15% returns, beating most active managers.  
- **Direct equity for higher returns**: Allocate 30–40% of the portfolio to direct stocks for 15–20% returns, using trend and fundamental analysis.  
- **Trend riding & fundamentals**: Use long-term (5–10 year) revenue/profit trends and technical charts (supports/resistances) to assess stock valuation.  
- **Step-up/down SIPs**: Invest more in downtrends (step-up SIP), less in uptrends (step-down SIP) to optimize returns.  
- **Retirement planning**: A 25 crore portfolio generating 14% returns (10% inflation-adjusted) can sustain 4 crore annual expenses.  
- **Avoid broker targets**: Most price targets are unreliable; focus on fundamentals and trends instead.  
- **Time efficiency**: Spend 15–20 minutes daily on educated actions rather than overcomplicating strategies.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ued assets first Then you move then you sell fairly valued assets subsequently, okay? You do not typically sell undervalued things Your best friend in all of these is your patience that if you're patient you will always get great opportunities to buy You will always get great opportunities to sell but if you're a desperate person right who only knows like SIP in mutual fund then yeah, it's just bad, okay? So like you will always feel that always to unnecessarily invest money I have always maintained Investing is an opportunity game the If sensible opportunities are there invest if sensible opportunities are not there To not invest there is no pressure on you for investing let it rot Okay for like one year two year money and all that Warren Buffett is also sitting on cash no so So it's a good idea right? I mean it's not as if that he's making any money on like you know his cash right so he also does the same So whenever the markets it's clearly overvalued be 100% Invested when the market is completely overvalued at least cut 30 40% positions Most of the time the market will be fairly valued, okay? So those ups and downs will not be that much so most of the times it will be fairly valued So there you have to capital rotate, okay? So this is where we will close the selling class, okay? Maybe I'll take like two questions right and then we will proceed from there Okay, she got I'm not sure whether you are continuing on more on technicals, but I wanted to know that if These are brokers in all give time targets three months may Some make some out of return or how is all that calculated or how do you gauge that? That's not my headache, right? So I mean I'll do whatever I know I'll bat the way I know how to bat now what broker's are saying or something like I Know 90% of the time the target are false So don't ever buy like so just simply look at like you know whatever targets have been met, okay? So they Z news will go up with them. They can 518 are you right? So you'll go mad right? I mean have high frequency trading We then also you'll not be able to keep up with Z news or CNBC hours because that's the situation, okay? So like even Jane Street will not be able to So See our job is to simplify investing our job now is not to over-complicate investing I can also teach you like you know 500 new techniques, but what's the point at the end of the day? You have full-time job you can maximum give it like 15 20 minutes to the market So in that 15 20 minutes can you take educated? Actions that's the intent with which I have taught this course otherwise I can teach you like you know 50 more techniques of technical analysis, but will it help no? I've taught you the most powerful ones Okay, so all right So for an individual stop to decide whether it's overvalued or no we have to rely on SM a technique right? For anything that's called as trend riding slash momentum For individual stocks we first look at the quality of the asset We look at three or five year ten year time frames We look at trends we look at channels we look at resistance supports if you're doing these four or five key things And then it gives a very good understanding of what is overvalued versus undervalued But for individual stocks how three five and ten years returns Can be used for example up estimate. Go over like for example Let's say Tata Motors, okay, so let's look at like how much returns has it given in ten years so ten years ago It used to be at five fifty eight okay five sixty so Tata Motors is the wrong stock because you know It's not it does not pass my quality checks. I'll not even analyze. Let's look at HDFC bank. Okay So here I like ten years. Okay, so what was the stock price ten years ago 500 okay? Now it is 1700 so it has gone three X in Ten years now how much have the revenues profits gone up by From 2015 so 2015 by the king of 50,000 grow revenue. That it has gone six X, okay net profits have gone seven X and stock prices only gone three X Oh This is like commons and so right here when she times or other she times ago, right? So that's a simple point. So this is one. So this is on a ten year basis now you do like five year basis It's a what is happening five years. So you avoid like parabolic things so just to Streamline the flow right so here five years how much return has it given it has given 1300 1700 so almost 35% okay in five years. Okay now how much have revenues profit changed from 2019 It has 250 times profits have almost 300 times 300 percent three X and Stock is only a 30 percent so to cut the long story short at least from a fundamental basis it kind of adds up Okay, then you look at finally you look at that trend riding so you go here you go on Supercharts you go to HDFC bank, okay Now Then you open up the I don't know why I like my reading view is not working properly I'll see okay, so this is your trend, okay So now what is a good trend what is an up trend? So this is still an up trend so we keep on retaining it right So this is also turning this is also turning so we'll not sell it as of now, okay now it might very well happen that You know this black line for example Okay, this black line for example moves like this this blue line for example Moves like this and that trend continues so we keep on riding this entire trend from here up until like maybe how many other years it continues So this is where we will We will be able to truly benefit because if we sell to all it's also huge Everyone gets it Exactly Okay, and one unrelated question to selling or this Increased money two percent discount I saw that message, but if you already have signed up How can we get that? Check with the ingrating. Yes, that's not like my headache My headache was to get to you guys discount which I've gotten how you engage with them arms about croak conference calls zoom call do everything Okay, so yeah, okay, so they will give you discount if you are my spoon. Yeah, not an issue. Okay Cool, so I hope that this is clear to everyone right now. Let me like for the next few minutes. Let me just quickly cover like some Yes, I'll take the question towards the end, okay, so Okay Okay, now let me just quickly comment on this slide. This is an important slide. Okay, idea is that if I'm looking to make 12 15% returns consistently on my portfolio 1520 plus what is it or what are like major moves I need to do? Okay, if you're looking to make well to 15% Very easy technique just stick to nifty 50 Sensex NASDAQ S&B 500 Pure, okay, those by blue chips by mutual funds by index, okay, so these are your best instruments to generate 12 to 15% Okay, if you generate 15% consistently you are beating 95% of active fund managers Okay, can you beat it? Yes, we have already had that conversation Why can you beat it because you can do something called as step up and step down SIP? Okay Now what is the meaning of step down SIP? Sorry step up SIP? So if we are in a downtrend Right, what do you do you do step? Up SIP if we are in an uptrend what do you do we do step? Down SIP what is the meaning of step up SIP that see man kiss you low on an average you invest one lack Step down SIP means that you don't invest more than 70 80 K Okay, whatever 30 K you have saved you save, okay, you wait for a downtrend here. How much do you invest you invest 1.3 lack? Everyone with me Okay, nothing complicated, okay, very simple nothing you know no complications here, okay? If you can also channel trade now that will allow you to book some profits on nifty all that stuff So that allows you to capital rotate then market will always give you opportunities to rotate capital Okay, add blue chips for example HDFC bank. It's on an uptrend, okay? So now you can enter that trend early Benefit from it, etc, etc. So that really helps so just play around with index and blue chip the risk level is very low And you can still generate an alpha, okay, so this is a very sustainable way of making returns, okay 12 to 15 percent Which are very good returns. There is nothing wrong. You're you are beating real inflation in the Indian economy By 3 4% right and you are sorting out your retirement, okay, so everyone with me on first strategy Then then comes second category of equal I'm not here at 12 percent 13 percent of all three things. I want 18 What can I do so I want somewhere on like 15 20 percent you have to have like at least 30 to 40 percent of direct equity portfolio Okay, this is what I target Okay, I don't want to get out of here 20 percent is this or no, this is my target. I'm very happy with it now Why am I happy with it? It's very simple Please remember my question from the first class that how much money do you need to retire? Okay, or when can you retire right so for example, let's say hypothetically Hypothetically I think it's a low my see portfolio is under CR plus okay, so it is right. I'm not getting now What do I need to do right I need to protect it? That is my strategy one that my principal loss neonatry I cannot run really fast with this portfolio. This is a lot of money for me. Okay And I need to at least generate like 10 percent CGR to cover inflation And on the rest 4 percent, okay, I can live off Okay, so if my portfolio is generating 14 percent 10 goes to inflation 4 percent goes to my expenses Okay, which means that 4CR is my early expense, okay? So if I'm experiencing this much, it's great, okay? So this gives me a power of spending for CR in inflation. It is a stud Thumbs and still retain that hundreds year portfolio, okay? Now you don't need hundreds here, right? So I like honestly even I don't worry about like making money and all that know For me, I mean, I think my early expense will be somewhere around once here Okay, because I travel a lot so between one one and a half years so that I'm more than happy So if I had 25 CR I can technically retire, okay at this equation everyone understood. Oh, okay? So 25 CR and I have like a lot of fixed expenses in the way that I own like And
