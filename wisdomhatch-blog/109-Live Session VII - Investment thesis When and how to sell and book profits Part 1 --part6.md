SUMMARY:
**  
The text explains the journey of a company from early-stage VC funding to IPO, emphasizing the unlisted (pre-IPO) stage where companies like Oyo, Wisdom Hatch, and NSC operate. It highlights how founders and investors aim to IPO for liquidity, using examples like Shark Tank participants (e.g., Oyo’s Ritesh Agarwal, Boat’s Aman Gupta) to illustrate PR-driven strategies before going public. The author critiques the speculative nature of public markets, comparing it to gambling, and shares a hypothetical example of valuing a YouTube channel to demonstrate how multiples inflate valuations during IPOs. The text also warns of the stress and risks involved in scaling companies and cites examples like Bombay Stock Exchange and Swiggy to show post-IPO volatility.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **IPO as Liquidity Event:** Founders and investors prioritize IPOs to monetize unlisted shares, often using PR to boost valuation pre-IPO.  
- **Speculative Public Markets:** Post-IPO, stock prices are highly volatile, with examples like Swiggy (peaks and crashes) and Paytm (failure to recover IPO price).  
- **Valuation Multiples:** Private companies inflate valuations using multiples (e.g., 10x revenue) to attract investors, creating a disconnect from actual profitability.  
- **Risks of Scaling:** Taking VC funding or going public sacrifices founder freedom and adds stress, making bootstrapping appealing for some.  
- **Market Manipulation:** The author cynically describes finance as a "pump-and-dump" game, where investment bankers and regulators artificially inflate companies.  
- **Investor Caution:** Early-stage investments (pre-IPO) can yield high returns but carry significant risk, as seen in Bombay Stock Exchange’s 66% drop before an 11x rally.  
- **No Control Over Outcomes:** Retail investors have little influence over IPO pricing or post-listing performance, making public markets akin to gambling.  

**Notable Examples:**  
- **Oyo, Boat, Lenskart:** Founders leverage PR/IPOs for exits.  
- **Bombay Stock Exchange:** 4-year slump post-IPO before massive rally.  
- **Swiggy/Paytm:** Extreme volatility post-listing, highlighting speculation risks.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ke $5 million. So the size of the company became this. Then series B happened. Then the size of the company became this. Then over time, it became like this. Now, this is like... Now, the stage between IPO and this. Where massive VC funding has happened is called as pre IPO stage. Where the company is still unlisted. So this is unlisted. What does the meaning of listed? Listed means listed on public exchange. So this becomes listed. So this stage here is called as unlisted stage. And here, you can buy certain categories of company. For example, wisdom hatch is an unlisted company. NSC is an unlisted company. Oyo right now is an unlisted company. But people know about Oyo. People do not know much about wisdom hatch. Why? Because I am not going to buy VC DC. And IPO, but Oyo, the founder is very ambitious guy. So he would want to IPO at one stage. So he will IPO here. And the moment it I POs, it becomes a part of public market. And then generally people enter into these types of stocks. So I hope that everyone is clear about this journey. That in this C2 VC stage, you have companies like wisdom hatch also. And you have companies like Oyo also. You have companies like NSC also. And all types of companies are there. CDJ, BCD, EF. Now, the important point to notice that in the unlisted space, if you are buying companies, you should primarily buy these type of companies. Okay. Why? Because these companies are likely to IPO. Now comes a very natural question. Why they will they IPO? Why can't they just stay like unlisted forever? Okay. So then comes the second point that for example, Ritesh Agarwal, founder of Oyo. What's the, when will Ritesh Agarwal make real money? Benda company, I POs. Now why do you think like shark tank and tire like judge, judge, then in that company, I PO, go back to the shark tank. Okay. Because after that a lot of hate will come. It will stop. Goals. Okay. So for example, that's that's how if like it majorly happening every shark is IPO. Right. For example, Mahamarth, person IPO. Okay. Lens card guy is going to IPO. Okay. Oyo like Ritesh Agarwal also came on shark tank. Why? Because he's about to IPO. Who else? Right. Aman Gupta, boat is going to IPO. Okay. So all these companies like why do you think like founder that doing like so much PR? What's the goal? Right. The goal is to make more money, right. For themselves and their investors and all that stuff. Okay. Now how do you make money in once the company goes from analyst and to list it? Okay. So the way it works is very simple. Right. For example, I run a YouTube channel. Okay. Now let's say my monthly income is hypothetically, let's say 10 lakh rupees. Okay. Now what is a PE on that income? One, why? Because it's like a job. Okay. I'm doing a job for YouTube. I'm making content. And at the end of the month, YouTube pays me 10 lakh salary. Because that's how I'm working. Okay. Now what is a PE on a salary? The answer is one. Okay. Why? Because there is a multiple that I'm getting. Okay. Now what I do is that I say that hey, you know what? I'll make my YouTube channel a tradable asset. Okay. What I'll do is that I'll issue 100 shares for my company at a valuation of 10 times multiples. Okay. So which leads to what that for example, 10 lakhs someone motavodavagadog is my salana revenue profits is one crore. Okay. Hi hypothetically. Now the valuation of my company becomes 12 crore. Not 12 people buy that. Okay. And I retain like, you know, 30, 40% of that company. Okay. Then rest 70%, 75% I liquid it. Okay. So all of you buy it. Okay. Now what I've done is that I've added a multiple of 10 to my company. Okay. Now you will say that, okay, I will say that you know, what actually company man, West, he had and he gave me an dividend of like, you know, say 7% okay. And I, I GFC banged it out. I saw it charted it, it was short. It was right and then she will pump up my company. Okay. Then she will go and find more people coming. Okay. So then she will bring her like, you know, sister, brother, all that stuff. So they will buy at 12 p. Okay. Then their sister brother also buy their cousins. Okay. So then they will also like participate. Now my company goes to 20 p. Okay. Then one day I IPO. Okay. Then everyone goes mad here. I know what? Okay. You know, wisdom has such great company. Missed I get my rally and all that stuff. So they will go and buy my company at 100 p. Okay. So now a company which is generating like a 12 crore profit, start trading at a 12, you know, 100 p. So what does that mean? That my valuation becomes roughly what about 12 100 crores. Okay. So now suddenly I'm a person who was making like 10 lakh rupees a month salary. Now I own a company which is worth 1200 crores. So did you see the magic? Okay. So that's how it works. Okay. So therefore finance is the stupidest thing on earth. Okay. So like and still they get the most important thing because the entire job of consultants, investment bankers, regulators is to pump up companies. Okay. So I'm just telling you honest facts. I don't give a shit. Okay. So that's how it goes. Okay. So now you say, okay, so the problem is that it comes with a lot of stress. Okay. For example, a lot of like very seasoned VCs wants to invest in my company. But the moment I take their money, my freedom is gone. Okay. Now my call jet skiing. Okay. I'm a valve. We are VCC that bathed. We are BS. I mean, I'm not just at that type of a person. There's no point. I'll rather enjoy my life with whatever money I have. Okay. I'm not able to spend it. Okay. So I'm focusing on spending my money. I'm not focusing on growing from like whatever. 100 crores to 1000 crores. Okay. So money is what I'm like through investing money. Right. So why take all that headache? Okay. People get very stressed also. So it comes with a lot of health risks. Okay. So I have friends. I'm going to be a big money. Right. So that's what I'll do. Right. For example, just I encourage money guys. Right. So smart guys right. I mean, I am in the bath, gold, medallist, IT Bombay. Right. So which I mean, who runs incredible. Very smart guy. Good team. Their job is to build B. Okay. That's what they are doing. Okay. So customer to get money. I don't know. I don't know. I don't care. Okay. So that's the benefit of running like a bootstrap company. I don't even do an advert actually. Okay. Who won I add? Right. So I'm going to say it's not as if that I don't want to like make more money. Right. So I do much effort. I'm tired. Right. So there's no point. Okay. So I'd rather watch like Netflix. Okay. I'll see the case. Right. So Netflix. So I'm like on get it. So I mean, it's like I'm too old. And okay. So I hope but hope this gives you a sense of how companies are built. Okay. Does it look scammy? Yes. Can you do anything about it? No. Okay. What can you do? Right. You will say that again, no. I'm the principal in Sanev. We are not going to buy like such companies and all that stuff. But then you cannot you should stop investing. Okay. See, stock investing is a speculation game. Okay. The most speculation happens here in public markets. Okay. So let me show you concrete examples. Okay. So for example, if you consider something like, let me show you two three examples. Right. So BSE. Okay. Bombay stock exchange limited. How do people think about Bombay stock exchange limited? They will think that a market cap is 75,000 crore. It's a monopoly company. This is that stuff. Okay. So they will think about all these things. Okay. Now if you would have bought and here is where IPO had happened of Bombay stock exchange at 356 rupees. Then in 2070. Okay. Then it went down, down, down, down, down, down, down, down. For four years, you made nothing. Right. For three, four years. And the valuation got crushed by almost 66%. Okay. So imagine someone had bought an IPO of Bombay stock exchange, a public government company and lost 66% of the capital. What would they think? They'll say, yeah, this is a Bacuase. Right. I mean, I don't know. It's not over. After three years. So this is massive loss for you. Right. But then what happened? You sold it here. Right. Now you sold it here. A little bit of recovery. Then all that right. Okay. So you know, you exited here. And after that, it went like 11X. Okay. What about like, let's say something like, let's say, Swiggy. Okay. What happened with Swiggy? Swiggy is here. Okay. It IPO had 456. It went to 2600. Okay. Then it got crushed and it came back to 350. Okay. But here is the magic. Okay. So I don't know how many people bought Swiggy in this stage. Right. This was pre IPO. Unillisted space. So I bought it at 360 rupees. Okay. If this is here, right. This is my price here. I'm like staring at a 10% loss. It's not end of the world or for a stock like Swiggy. Why? Because even in the market context, the entire market itself is corrected by 15% no. So it's not as if you know what I have taken like some dramatic hit on like Swiggy's stock and all that. Plus what have I been able to successfully buy? I have been able to buy at least a 45% price correction. Okay. Everyone gets gets this point. Okay. So to cut the long story short, right. What is happening right now is that the entire goal of IPO market is to pump the stock. Okay. Like this. This is like pure gambling. Okay. And then a price discovery happens. Right. And we don't know what that price discovery will be. Even the listing price is just way too high. Majority of the time. For example, this opened at 456. If the market would have continued to run up, this stock might have reached 800 or something. Okay. So there is just no way we can figure that out. That what is going to happen. Pay TM. Okay. And then I will give you like E take away on this. See, if you consider pay TM now what happened on pay TM. Pay TM opened here 1560. You would have run to bought by like 1560. Okay. And you have not been able to recover your money up until now. Everyone understands. So wh
