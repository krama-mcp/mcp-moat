SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses the risks and strategies of investing in micro-cap companies, using Swiggy and PayTM as examples. They emphasize buying at a 50% "margin of safety" (a significant price drop) to mitigate risk, citing PayTM's volatile stock history (68% drop, 225% rise, then 33% drop) as a case for timing investments during corrections. The speaker acknowledges speculation is inherent in the stock market but frames it as a calculated risk-reward decision with stop-loss measures. They conclude by humorously comparing stock investing to gambling while defending a sensible approach.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Margin of Safety Matters:** Buying after a ~50% price correction reduces risk and improves potential returns (e.g., PayTMâ€™s recovery after a 68% drop).  
- **Price Discovery Volatility:** Stocks like PayTM undergo extreme fluctuations; timing entries during downturns can yield high rewards.  
- **Risk Management:** Use stop-loss orders to limit losses, treating speculation as a calculated gamble rather than blind betting.  
- **Market Realism:** The speaker admits the stock market has gambling-like traits but advocates for disciplined strategies over reckless trading.  
- **Psychological Aspect:** Humor underscores the tension between rational investing and emotional/perceived gambling behavior.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
you know, micro cap companies and all that stuff. That's bad because at least Swiggy has some value going for it. Okay. I agree that Swiggy is going through a price discovery. But buying it at 50% margin of safety is a decent enough margin for you. Right. I mean, get any price discovery. You know, right? I mean, for example, even if you check like, like, you know, for example, let's say, pay T and went through like, it's 197 communication. Right. Stop. 197. Pay T and. Yeah. Okay. Yes. Okay. For example, how much value got eroded from pay T. At one point. Okay. So pay T and stock fell by 68%. Okay. And then it went up also from 68% to how much? To here by 225%. Okay. Then it came down again by 33%. And then it is up. So for example, if you would have bought like a 50% right? You would have bought it here. Right. For example, 50% play assuming that you are pay T. I'm the ticki. Right. I mean, for the next three, five years, then you could have potentially exited here. No, this thing. Are you getting what I'm trying to say? Right. Because that two is to one trade kind of makes sense. Price discovery, I'll point 100% agree with you. But I'm not asking you to speculate at the top. I'm asking you to speculate when 50% correction has happened. Okay. And that too with the stop loss. So it's about risk reward equation. I'm like, I don't know like I'm in how your parents will feel that you are taking a gambling class or whatever, right? But this is what like, you know, it is right. So, yeah. Okay. So. Yeah. So you are doing it sensibly. And stock market is gambling. Okay. So I like I cannot like give it a positive spin. Okay. So that's how it is. Right. So I hope you enjoyed the class so far. Right. We'll take like a seven minute break. I'll be back at like 645. And then we will continue further. Okay. Okay.
