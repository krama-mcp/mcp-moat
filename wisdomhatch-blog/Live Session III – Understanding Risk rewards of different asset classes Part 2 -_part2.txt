==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses how financial markets, particularly in India, are artificially managed by key players like the government, domestic institutional investors (DIIs), and foreign institutional investors (FIIs). It highlights the influence of entities like LIC (Life Insurance Corporation of India) in stabilizing markets, the government's role in appointing officials to align with its policies, and the importance of understanding these dynamics for investors. The author emphasizes that market crashes (e.g., parabolic falls) present opportunities for wealth creation if investors remain calm and buy strategically, as interventions (e.g., quantitative easing) often follow. The text also warns against retail investors panicking and exiting markets during downturns, stressing the need to align with the strategies of top players (e.g., FIIs, DIIs) to benefit long-term. Examples from Turkey and the 2020 COVID crash are cited to illustrate government-market interactions and investor behavior.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Markets are managed:** Governments and institutions (e.g., LIC, DIIs) actively stabilize markets, often intervening during crashes to prevent systemic collapse.  
- **Opportunities in crises:** Sharp market declines (e.g., COVID-19 crash) are key moments to invest, as governments typically inject liquidity to spur recovery.  
- **Retail investor pitfalls:** Most retail investors panic and exit during downturns, missing long-term gains. Success requires mimicking top players (FIIs/DIIs).  
- **Government influence:** Central banks (e.g., RBI) and policies are often shaped by political agendas, as seen in Turkey’s frequent governor changes.  
- **Diversification & patience:** Investors should diversify and avoid emotional decisions, as markets are designed to reward long-term participation (e.g., via SIPs).  
- **Institutional incentives:** FIIs, DIIs, and governments benefit from market growth (via taxes, fees, portfolio hedging), ensuring efforts to sustain the system.  
- **Historical lessons:** Past scams (e.g., Harshad Mehta) scarred retail investors, but understanding market mechanics can prevent similar mistakes.  
- **Generational wealth:** Agile investors who capitalize on managed market cycles (e.g., buying dips) can achieve significant wealth accumulation.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
. So when statements are made in the parliament, really stupid statements that we don't need like foreign investors, that's not, it's bad. Okay. So it should not be encouraged by you also, right. Because if foreign institutional investors starts going away from the Indian markets, it's a huge problem, right. So this is both required. The important key takeaway for you as an investor is that the markets are managed. If markets are not managed, then both FIIs and DIIs would look at the same data and sell stocks that month, okay. And it would happen very frequently, but it happens very rarely, okay. I hope everyone gets it, okay. Now how DIIs buy stocks, it's very simple. For example, who controls India stock market? Almost 20% of the money in the Indian stock market is owned by LIC. 20% of India stock market is made up of LIC's investment alone, okay. You don't even require like second party, okay. Now who appoints the chairman MD of LIC? Okay. Now if the government of India tells the LIC chairman, if he buys a Gharilayaka, then he stock, okay. But do you think he'll say no? But does he have the guts to say no, right. So the point being that this can be done at a market level, this can be done at an individual stock level, okay. You have to understand whether or not you want to speculate at a market level or you want to speculate at a RANI level, okay. All those points are there, okay. But the fact being that we just assume that you know, RBI decides a monetary policy of India. Which, why? I mean, it really depends on the government. What policy they want to execute? The RBI, governor gets changed. For example, Urjit Patel was an RBI governor, right. And he resigned, right. Because he was not agreeing with them and it. This happens not only in India, this happens at multiple countries. For example, Eruyan, who's the Turkish Prime Minister of President, right. He changed like five central governor, a central bank governors in a span of two years. Five, why? Because his point of view was that we will not raise interest rates, okay. We will keep the interest rates really low. And Turkey paid a lot of price for that poor economic choice. Governor came, they said that you're not boss. This is like wrong economic policy. He said, screw you, I'll change you. Okay, so then any change next guy, do you agree with me? No, okay, you also change. Like third guy, okay, you agree with me? No, so finally, bounce on one who agreed with him. Okay, and that's how RBI or sorry, that's how their central bank agreed with the government eventually. Okay, so that's how it goes. Okay, I hope that this point is clear. Markets are artificially managed. You can't do anything. Okay, so you and I are too small a fish to do anything on this. Okay, power gets replaced by Trump. How will it affect the US talks? Yeah, it doesn't matter, right, to be honest. This is beyond our pay scale. We should know this, right? But at the same time, it teaches us the importance of diversification, but you should not worry too much about it. Because if markets are being managed, what is our role? Our role is not to panic. For example, if you see this in the market, okay, if you see a parabolic fall here, what should you do? You should buy as much as possible on a parabolic fall. Why? Because what is the government's next step? Quantitative easing. They will release money into the economy. RBI will ask what? RBI will ask LIC to buy X crores of equities that day and stabilize the market. And this is your crazy money making opportunity. Okay, if you, if this slow decaying has happened, what is likely to happen? Well, side of his movement is likely to happen. Okay, they are waiting for time correction. This is what the macro class we learned yesterday, right? Here, what is happening? They are trying to, the, this will be panic. Step one will be panic. Step two will be sharp recovery. How? Because this can be done fairly quickly. Okay, this entire chain, the counter buyers will come and buy the dip. Okay. So if, but you can only execute on these things, if you truly understand how the system operates on the backend, are you understanding? If you don't understand this, you will see a parabolic fall. You will, you will just dress out and you will leave the market forever at a loss. Okay. And honestly, the most money you would have made wasn't 20 20. Those opportunity hasn't come back. I really hope market correct, but 70%. I'll be the happiest person. Okay. So I'm setting like on a lot of cash. I can do that. So that is the crazy money-making opportunity. That is where you and I, because we are extremely agile, we can invest a lot of money really fast and we can benefit. That is when generational wealth is created. Honestly, I was able to double my net worth right in like 2020 COVID, right? Because of this. Yeah. And I'm waiting. I'm very happy with that. Right? And I'm happy sort of doing it. Okay. Now, comes a very natural question. You see, very interesting theory, right? Have we somewhat agree? But what if the market falls permanently? For example, if a parabolic fall happens, like in 2020, and it falls, right? Then what happens? How are you sure? So sure that it will go back up. Now, here, what you need to understand is that you need to understand the concept of market participants. Okay. The first participant in the market is government. Okay. The second participant in the market is FII, right? Which are hedge funds, Warren Buffett, Redalio. Third participants are DIs. Fourth participants are retail people like you and me. Okay. Now, today, market is at 22,500. Okay. Today, right in 2025, right now. Okay. Now, let's say three years happen, right? 20, 28, market, stay there, 22,500. What will you do? Number one, you will stop investing. Agree. Okay. For example, this year, 30% people have stopped their NPS. Okay. For some reason, I don't know why. Okay. SIPs, that was started last year. They are all at a loss. You would have seen it on your SIP also. Okay. Because why? Because retail people worry about what? Retail people are very simple people. Okay. So I will say, if money is not getting made for me regularly, I will move away from the stock market. This is your first winning advantage. That if you don't play this game. Okay. You have to play the game, what top 1% are playing? You cannot play the game, what 99% people are playing to make money. Okay. So this is one that if for example, from 2025 to 20, 20, 28, if you see zero returns on your portfolio, your natural step will be, if it's a good thing, I will do every day, if it's a good thing, I will do gold, if it's a good thing, I will just buy land. Natural, right? I mean, you agree. Okay. So you will go away from the market. Correct. So for example, at its peak, there were, I think, around how many? Close to like two CR participants, something like this on the stock market. Now it is down to like one CR or something. Now by 20, 28, if the market does not improve, right? And it does not give you at least at 10% returns. The outflow of these people will be very high. Okay. A classic case study is 1992 scam or 1991 scam, Harsha Metha scam. For example, many of your parents would never have touched stock market because of Harsha Metha episode. Then they lost their life saving and since then, it became like a gambling, right? Kee, the Kaya Bhai, like in a stock market, Karnika Bakar, Jwaja, Jwaja and whatnot. So they do not touch it. So governments mandate or governments objective is to keep this game alive for real estate retail investors, okay? Make them do SIP so that they stay active in the market and this population, whoever can invest, invest. What's the benefit to the government? S T T, security transaction tax, GST, they will charge corporate tax because when you are transacting more on FNO, when you are transacting via Zeruda, Zeruda makes money. So Zeruda will pay corporate tax. There are 100 different taxes that government will make. Okay. Number two, what is the benefit for DII to keep this game alive? That, you know, by 2028, you will at least make like 10% C H DR, you're giving it. Okay. What's the advantage for FII? Sorry, DII. These are HDFC AMC, all the SIP. So SIP, the way it works is that you will do 10,000 SIP, give it to HDFC AMC. HDFC manager will charge his 1% commission and invest on your behalf and he will pocket this. Okay. And keep on saying SIP is the best. This is that stuff and you keep on doing like SIP and he'll give you a return at the end and show you that in what bus if you would have done FD, you would have make 5% with me, you made 10%. At least, buddy, I'll do it for you. Right. So now DII also make money if the market is going up. Correct. Because they are collecting their expense regime. Okay. Now, what is the benefit for FII? Well, they can take asymmetric risk. For example, whatever VC funds, private equity funds are there. What do they make by investing in companies like by Jews, investing in companies like CRED, investing in companies like X, Y, Z? They are able to invest in emerging markets. For example, Warren Buffett has no need to come and invest as money in India. But why will he invest in India? Because a part of his portfolio goes to emerging markets. From hedging, for example, a part of my portfolio right now goes to developed markets. Right. In next 10, 15 years, almost 70, 75% of my portfolio will be developed market. 20% will be emerging markets. Right. But for Warren Buffett right now, his emerging market portfolio will be 10%. But to attract that 10% amount from Warren Buffett, from RIDALO, bunch of different investors, Indian government tries really hard. Right. And why would these investors invest? Because they see that a Chinese market is thriving, I can make my money. Right. For example, if I want an exit, in the end, that's how they will give me exit. OK. I'll say, I'll take it. How do I say, I want my exit? OK. So I don't want to get stuck in my liq
