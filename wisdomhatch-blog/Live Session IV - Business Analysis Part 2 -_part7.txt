SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses various challenges in Indian real estate, particularly tenancy laws that make it difficult for landlords to evict tenants, whether in commercial or residential properties. The speaker prefers touristy properties (e.g., Airbnb) to avoid squatter issues. The conversation then shifts to stock market investing, emphasizing the complexity of picking individual stocks, especially in sectors like pharmaceuticals ("farmer" stocks), which are highly regulated and export-dependent. The speaker advises focusing on simpler, consumption-driven sectors in India rather than complicated export-oriented ones. Additional topics include differentiating time correction/consolidation in markets, criticisms of pension schemes (NPS), and the importance of understanding sectors before investing.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
1. **Real Estate Challenges in India:**  
   - Tenancy laws are weak, making it hard for landlords to evict tenants, leading to legal and financial headaches.  
   - Commercial properties are riskier due to stronger tenant protections compared to residential ones.  
   - Tourist/short-term rental properties (e.g., Airbnb) are preferred to avoid long-term tenancy disputes.  

2. **Stock Market Investing:**  
   - Avoid overly complex sectors like pharmaceuticals ("farmer" stocks) due to regulatory, export, and import dependencies.  
   - Focus on consumption-driven sectors (e.g., retail, insurance) that benefit from India’s domestic growth.  
   - Individual stock picking requires deep research and conviction; ETFs or sector-level bets may be simpler for beginners.  

3. **Market Corrections:**  
   - "Time correction" (consolidation) and "price correction" are distinct; the former involves sideways movement, the latter a price drop.  
   - Corrections can be buying opportunities if the drop is significant from recent highs.  

4. **Pension Schemes (NPS):**  
   - The speaker dismisses the New Pension Scheme (NPS) as a slow-growth instrument and prefers alternatives.  
   - Criticizes over-analyzing "bad" options (e.g., comparing white vs. brown rice) when both are suboptimal.  

5. **Investing Approach:**  
   - Full-time investors (like the speaker) spend hours analyzing sectors/stocks, but part-time investors should focus on consuming curated insights.  
   - Prioritize sectors with clear growth narratives (e.g., India’s consumption story) over speculative bets.  

6. **Risk Management:**  
   - Be prepared for volatility (e.g., 40–60% drops in small caps) and invest only in businesses you understand deeply.  
   - Simplicity in strategy (e.g., buying indexes for complex sectors) often outpercomes overcomplication.  

Notable Quote:  
*"Pick the simplest theme possible... Buy [companies] at reasonable levels. Why take complicated bets?"*

ORIGINAL TEXT:
say a jewellery store. Now that person's livelihood is dependent on that shop. And if he decides not to vacate your shop, you'll go to the court. The court will say that, you know what? You will get stuck. Because it's very difficult to kick a person out, right? A commercial shop compared to a residential real estate in India. Even residential real estate laws are very complicated. But the point is that at least a bjili card is okay, a few cards, all that. But the law is the problem. Right? And when it comes to like real estate tenancy, the tenancy laws in India are really weak. Okay? Both from a tenant side and from a landlord side. So therefore getting into commercial real estate is very complicated. In fact, the properties that are by in India, why do I do why am I buying like touristy properties? The reason is very simple. That Airbnb pay if someone comes and stays at my property for a month, maybe it's not as if they can become squatters there. Okay? So that's the issue, right? In areas like Dwarka, all that in Delhi, that is the precise problem that happens that many people just grab your house and refuse to vacate and it becomes a night marriage scenario, especially if you're busy, right? So that's the headache, right? So I mean, hoes up, but why you're into all that jig jig for like, you know, 3, 4% rental yield? That's my point. Okay. Thank you. All right. Yeah. I actually thank you so much. Actually, I have a doubt when you say time correction and consolidation, what's the difference? I mean, how do I differentiate that this is consolidation period and this is time correction? No, so that's one and the same thing. Basically, consolidation means a rectangular pattern has been formed. That is time correction only. And another thing is every time I see a downward trend, is that a price correction that's happening? Yes. Yeah. That's a price correction. Correct. Every day is a price correction. Okay, so that's a good time to buy. Yes. You have to check how much it has gone down from the recent top. Correct. I'm pretty new. I mean, pretty new. Absolutely new. So I'm like still working on it. So no problem. Thank you. No problem. Okay. Yeah. Arjun, yes. Arjun, Bharat. Yeah. Hi, Arjun. Hi. Yeah. Yeah. Hi, XS. I want to know what is that difference between which one is a good actually old pension or new pension scheme? I don't know. 10 new bonuses? Like, yes. So I'm not for me, NPS does not make much sense. I'm not studied it any longer. Right. So therefore, I don't have any comments on old versus new. Right. So for me, it's as slow growth instruments. I don't touch it. Right. So neither do I advocate people do it. Right. But the old one is good as for your pension. I don't know. Like, if something is bad, I'll not study it only. Right. I mean, whether what version of it is bad is like, you know, useless. For example, eating too much carbs is bad. So it's a nonsense. Divided like whether white rice is good or brown rice is good. Both are bad. I did little quantity. That's the idea. Right. So, yeah. Thank you. Thanks. Bharat. Yeah. I actually, the for your time and valuable insights from past two days, I think I really enjoyed journey so far. I have been investing since February 20, 24 to be precise. Computer, my equity exposure is about now around 10 lakhs now. And when the market was falling about the maximum of 15, 16 percent, given I was at the fall of 15 percent. But now as the market is recurring, now I'm at the fall of 8 percent. So my question is like, I have been fairly investing in individual stocks as well. My 15 percent of my portfolio is in ETFs currently. Okay. Yeah. Where I have picked up for not these private bank ETFs after seeing your videos on YouTube. And similar way, I see there is a correction in few of the farmer stocks where I am little lower exposed, I feel because NATCO format is not going to be enough. Going forward, should I invest in these individual stocks as such or just because the farm abuse and just keep adding when in the channel, see similar to private bank, private bank ETF. Something similar to that is a good strategy or because the inverse of like, for example, NATCO has fallen from 1200 to 800 now. Is it? Which is going to be? See, what I've, what I've realized after of what I've realized like, you know, looking at the last four or five years is that if you're picking individual stocks, then you need to be steadfast. Right? I mean, you need to have very clear understanding why you're picking that stock. Now, problem with farmer stocks is that it's very complicated industry to analyze and understand for an outsider. It's one of the most complex businesses to understand because it's very export dependent. It's very import dependent in the sense that you need access to certain type of chemicals to make like medicines. It's very regulatory oriented. So what I've understood is that for me, don't buy individual farmer stock. Right? So that's a simple point. I will rather buy it at an index level. Same with like something like genome editing in the US that genome editing is a very good industry to pick. But the problem is that individual stocks are so complicated to analyze that there is no point in picking individual stocks there and same as the issue with Indian farmer. Right? Because what happens is that for example, not go farmer fell because of a drug trial, right? And bunch of other different things that was going on the farm. Right? Now, we don't know how to process this news. But if for example, if let's say, hero motor car sales dip happens on its two wheeler, then you can still make sense of it. Okay. For example, it's a fine interest rates are high. Therefore, low pass people primarily buy on emi. So therefore, like, you know, it's an issue. But with time, like as interest it gets cut, it will recover. But there is no recovery path that we can see on like farmer and understand that news. That's the complexity of buying like farmer business. If you understand, it will buy it, right? But I am not personally buying which I would rather buy hospitals at rather buy like insurance companies because that business I understand more. On the contrary, there is a there are most of the Indian farmers selling this dollars. So the revenue what they get also is in US dollars. They are already we make some whatever the four, five percent leverage apart from the standard nifty growth message. That is one thing which I say is. If you want US denominated assets and buy US talks, why are you going by Indian farmer to invest in like US? Okay. So why buy something export dependent? Buy something which will benefit from consumption. Pick the simplest theme possible. For example, India is a consumption market. This story should be clear in our head. India most of the growth is generated because there are so many of Indians, right? Us who are consuming everyday stuff. Buy those type of companies more at discount at the reasonable level. That is sure short growth. Why take like complicated beds? Which I Indian farmer will sell to US farmer? I would have terminated RF. Right? So then we have screwed. So there are 100 different problems there. So it becomes very difficult to hold a stock because you will only make money. For example, if you ask me like thesis on let's say Arman financials. I can explain it to you. I mean it makes sense. I can I'm happy to hold it at 40 percent fall also. And small caps will go through that 40, 50 percent, 60 percent fall also. So that's the thing. So under consumption does income of a totally tata not just zero. Tata what does I'm not buying? I'm buying two alerts. India my consumption at two alerts. Right? So I'll buy that. I'll not buy four wheelers. Tata Motors. Okay. Thank you so much. All right. Kishore Sandra. Hey, actually, thanks for the session yesterday and today. I've been part of the YouTube community also the last six months. One of the challenges that I'm facing is like I follow your commentary. So you start with one second like direct banks was the focus that you moved on to financials. This AMC company and so on. So how do you pick a sector and kind of go down into it? So for example, if I and because I'm asking if this is a point of view that how much time should I look at to studying these sectors and then the specific companies or how do do it broadly? I mean now because there are a lot of companies to analyze right you see that okay. Arman financials have been chalbered with the new I go and look and see now. Yeah, chalbered. So how do you like zero down on which companies and sectors to analyze at that point? Yeah, it's my full time job. Right. So because I make like content. I run a hedge fund. I invest my own capital. If I my family will just hide into like investing. So I'm a full time investor. Right. So you don't need to be one right. I mean there is no point in you being one. You need to be a better consumer of data. Right. So for example, if you're watching a YouTube video of mine, if you're watching a YouTube video of someone else, if you're reading a news article, how you process that information is more important. For example, I'm statistician. Right. I mean, I will create that picture for you. Right. But you don't need to become a statistician to understand statistical data. You must understand how to read statistics. Right. So that is more important for you. So my process is pretty much useless. Right. I mean, unless you have like four or five hours a day, there is no point in you getting into and you're not trying to copy what I'm doing. So yeah. But basically how many are teaching you got it. So basically then my fallback plan is basically looking at broadly what sectors you're talking about. And then because you also suggest that you do your own research and all that. So I also try to look at financials from my end also try to see some annual reports and see what other information is there about the industry. Second question
