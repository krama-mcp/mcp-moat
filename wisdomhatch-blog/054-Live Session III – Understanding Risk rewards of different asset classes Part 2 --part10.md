==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a fragmented discussion about investing in US stocks, tax implications for Indian residents, and strategies for handling market volatility. Key points include the tax burden on Indian residents investing in US stocks (12.5% LTCG), the potential benefits of relocating to a tax-friendly jurisdiction like the UAE (0% LTCG), and challenges like TCS (Tax Collected at Source) and remittance fees. The conversation also touches on portfolio management during market downturns, emphasizing buying more during corrections rather than attempting to time exits.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Tax Implications for Indian Investors in US Stocks:** Indian tax residents must pay 12.5% LTCG on profits from US stocks, along with TCS and remittance charges.  
- **UAE Tax Advantage:** Becoming a UAE tax resident allows investors to avoid LTCG taxes on US stock profits (0% as of now).  
- **Market Volatility Strategy:** Instead of trying to time exits during parabolic falls, the advice is to buy more during corrections to benefit from eventual recoveries.  
- **Portfolio Resilience:** A well-diversified portfolio may fall less than the market during downturns, but some decline is inevitable.  
- **Practical Challenges:** High remittance costs and tax complexities discourage aggressive US stock investing for Indian residents.  
- **Long-Term Mindset:** Patience and completing educational resources (like courses) are emphasized for making better investment decisions.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
gs I should get this also this also this also go to your I see it's an opportunity go through the course you'll be able to make better judgments right so that's the idea behind the post right so just let it complete you'll have a better idea and also my current portfolio was I have been working in a job for one year it's like eight alpio so it will it's gonna grow this year I'm planning to invest around 16 to 20 legs on top of that money so any good practices you would uh because you're already just just be patient listen to the entire course you yourself will get an idea so watch this course twice right and you'll have that would have clarified majority of your doubts okay thank you uh on get yes hi hi hi check there was a mention in the previous classes that if you have a certain corpus in ua stock so that actually helps you to like I don't know become a UA text resident or maybe you can transfer your corpus to UA what was I'm just trying to understand that part also since yes so basically what happens is that if for example you are buying as an Indian tax resident you're living in India you're buying US stocks right and if you book profits on that portfolio you'll have to pay 12.5 percent tax why because you're an Indian tax resident okay but you pay that LTCG only when you book profits on US stocks now let's say that you have started investing in US stocks now okay you continue to invest the portfolio keeps going up so from let's say 50 lakhs and go to five per cent right now you're sitting on four and a half a year profit now it might make sense for you and if you're out of job or like you know if you have the option to migrate to UAE and become a tax resident there you become a tax resident there and now because you're a UA tax resident booking profits on UA booking profits on US stocks the LTCG as per today's role is zero so you pay zero stuff so that's what I was trying to tell okay yeah all right there yeah hey uh actually so I wanted to understand as you just now said that you know being in India if you want to book profit when you are investing in US stocks is then you have to end up then you end up paying LTCG right so even if like let's say I go through vested or in money and I invest let's say in Netflix Netflix was at six hundred dollars of a few months back and then I invested in that and it went to eight hundred it even went to thousand but I actually uh when it was around eight forty I wanted to book some profit and invest that money in amazon it did not hit my account but it did hit the account or the drive well account that happened that is present in that eight money right that is also profit booking only yes correct your book profits so that's capital gain so whichever countries resident you are in you will have to pay taxes as per that country's law so I guess rotating money as of now in India when you are investing in US stock is not a good uh uh plan to go about yeah technically yes and because you are comparing it to UA right so but if you stop that comparison then anyways I mean for any Indians talk you are selling even if I either selling in India they are paying twelve and a half percent tax yeah but the problem is that I pay that TCS amount which when I put my money in in in in in the money right you like a certain amount you have to pay like some 20 percent of TCS and then on top of that there is also LTCG if there is some profit booking that is the only problem that I was not the problem but that's the confusion I had that is not hitting my account but still it is hitting the drive well the count which is so it doesn't matter no so what is happening is that's it you're going to the US market to trade you're buying a US denominated asset but you're a tax resident of India so when you buy US stock you're at you're buying US denominated asset now as per tax treaty between US and India if you're booking profits in the US market you have to pay taxes wherever you are a tax resident of so you're a tax resident of India so therefore you have to pay twelve and a half percent tax on your US investments also now that's a separate argument altogether that you have to pay TCS also remittance charge also all that that is being done by for transferring money from India to the US right. Well Bob what's your strategy when you do when you deploy money in in I know that you are from currently you're doing it from UAE but if you are deploying money and if you were in India and you were deploying in US stocks what are your strategies. No there is no strategy here and I mean these these are very clear cut rules so therefore I was not investing very aggressively in the US market because there was no option for me to do it right I mean therefore I had to make the call to like you know sort of shift to UA because for me like my investment income is a lot right so being like inability to rotate capital inability to trade in futures and options sensibly inability to book short-term profits long-term profits paying crazy money for remittances at my scale it was hurting me right so therefore I had to make that shift and go through all the pain that came with it right so so yeah I mean that was the eventual call that I made but if I were in India it would still be okay right I mean because you are in India is paying twelve and a half percent on Indian stocks also so it's not as if that you are being additional tax by going to the US market right PCS and all pain is there but again the point being that the moment you transfer like let's say one lakh rupees and convert that into a US stock you are getting dollar appreciation also okay yeah yeah you're right that's it hmm uh let me see yes hi action you talked about buying in a parabolic phone but would you be should you be exiting before the fall and if so how would you identify you will not be able to right so that's the problem right I mean I can tell you like you should exit this that stuff see adding stocks is easier selling stocks is very complicated right so there's no good time to sell right I mean because you don't know for example 2008 crisis the drop was 66 percent over to crisis the drop was around 45 percent right now if you're just sitting in 2020 not buying between when the market is corrected 45 percent or not maxing audio positions at 45 percent you would have not invested that money you know and that 45 percent when it went back to its previous I you missed all the gains on that money okay so the point being that the only thing to be done on a parabolic fall is to buy more that's it okay it's not about protecting your portfolio it's about see when you get into a boxing ring you will get hit you will bleed okay and you will hurt when you have to go through that pain to win the match right so that's what happens in a falling market you can't protect your portfolio in a falling market thank you okay but the way you will measure that is that see the market fell 45 percent my portfolio fell 15 percent your portfolio still fall but it will fall a lot less if you're buying continuously right sir okay awesome nice so I will see you like enough you hours right and hope you enjoy the class right and uh yes so in the evening we'll meet and we'll do fundamental analysis okay no it wasn't taking
