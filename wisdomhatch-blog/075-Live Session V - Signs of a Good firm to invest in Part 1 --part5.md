SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses the concepts of vertical and horizontal integration using Asian Paints as an example, contrasting it with industries like automotive (Tata Motors) and food delivery (Zomato). It emphasizes Asian Paints' resilience due to its established market position, distribution network, and low risk of disruption, while also exploring smaller players like Indigo Paints. The speaker argues for diversification in investments (e.g., private banks or paint companies) and dismisses overconcern about competitors like Adani. The analysis touches on brand equity, operational efficiency, and competition, concluding that Asian Paints remains a stable investment despite challenges.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Vertical vs. Horizontal Integration**: Asian Paints exemplifies horizontal integration (expanding into related products like wallpapers) and vertical integration (entering interior decor services), opening new markets.  
- **Industry Resilience**: Paints (Asian Pints) are less prone to disruption than industries like automotive (Tata Motors), where new entrants (e.g., BYD in EVs) can dominate.  
- **Investment Strategy**: Diversify within sectors (e.g., multiple paint companies or private banks) rather than focusing on a single stock. Smaller players (e.g., Indigo Paints) may offer higher growth potential.  
- **Competition & Moats**: Asian Paints' wide distribution network (25,000 dealers) and brand equity (moderate importance) act as moats against competition. Rising competition signals industry profitability but doesn’t necessarily threaten incumbents.  
- **Adani Concerns**: Overworrying about conglomerates like Adani entering markets is counterproductive; focus on company fundamentals instead.  
- **Long-Term Trends**: Stock prices may not immediately reflect profits, but fundamentals (revenue/profit growth) ultimately drive long-term returns.  
- **Narrow vs. Wide Moats**: Asian Paints’ narrow moat is its paint distribution; its interior business (wide moat) is still emerging. Brand strength varies by industry (critical for luxury goods, less so for paints).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
Are more houses getting constructed in India? Yes. Yes. So that's again not a problem. So to cut the long swoosh and final point that can the company undertake something called as vertical and horizontal integrations. Now what does that mean? A vertical integration and horizontal and the old time and other. So this is horizontal integration. This is vertical integration. Horizontal integration means that for example, if the company Asian paints manufacture all weather paints, okay, paints, basic paints, then they whatever like, you know, they let's say they start start doing like, you know, what do you call POP or whatever it is called. I'm not that will works with like, interiors. So this is not my area of expertise. I'm just using random examples. Then they issue like all weather paints. Okay. So this is like similar type of paints. Okay. Then they start getting into that wallpaper thing. Right. So you can stick wall papers and floor stickers, wallpaper, tiles, whatever. Then they can vertically integrate into interior decor, right, which they are already doing. So this is opens up a new market. Right. They allow you to design your own homes, right, custom studio. If you are in UAE, you would see that there is something called as Danube homes where you can literally go and buy like everything into it. That is dragon mart. You just go inside and you can literally furnish your house and like a day. Okay. Now all this physical expansion they can do now can Zomato compete with Asian paints on this this industry. Or at all, they are like completely different businesses. For example, if Zomato launches paint, no one gives a shit. Okay. So that's the point. Okay. So that is an irrelevant product. Okay. So to cut the long story short, right, Asian paints is still likely to survive three to five years. What is a mistake that you will make while buying Asian paints that you can buy expensive. Okay. And that's the mistake. It's not as if that business why it's a bad business to own. Right. It's a hype. So that's the bottom line. And this is the difference between Tata Motors and Asian paints that motor industry is stagnating. It is going through a fundamental shift. For example, EV Tata Motors might be great at conventional manufacturing. But tomorrow, B by D, which was which is probably like a 10 year 15 year old company, it can come and crush 100 year old automotive player. But can a new paint intern and come and crush Asian paints. No, because it's a low end manufacturing. It's not going to get disruptive. Okay. Paints as I know that you have invisible louse. Okay. So no, that's not something which is useful. Okay. Okay. So I hope this point is clear. Okay. Then why do you support indigo paints? So I'm so it's not about like an I'll buy only one company. Okay. So for example, if I'm buying this is something that I covered earlier that I will try to be diversified. Okay. Now, for example, if I'm buying private banks, I'll buy HDFC also, Kotec also, ICIC also, access also, all four are same for me. If I'm buying Asian paints, now I don't think that there's going to be a massive difference between Asian paints and, you know, Birlau, and you know, XYZ companies, right. Indigo paints is a very small guy. Okay. They will take some market share away. Right. So for them to double their market share from 10 units to 20 units is not that complicated. Why? Because it's a small cap company. So let me just help you understand this cap while argument also. So if you go here, right, you go on screen, not right. And you look at Asian paints. Now here you will see market cap of 2.24 lakh crores. Okay. So in the go paints, I'm sure in the go. 2.24 lakh crores. This is 4,000 crores. Okay. So what I'm betting on on indigo paints, I'm just betting on KIA, you know, this will become like maybe 20,000 crore company. In the next 10 years, even if that happens, I'm very happy. Okay. So this is a 2x stock for me. Okay. What is Asian paints for me? Asian paints is a 15% 13% stock for me that if it gives me 13% returns, I am very happy with Asian paints. But the objective of buying indigo paints is different. Okay. Now both of the companies, what is it that I need to check? I need to check the two things like that are the revenues growing? Yes. Are the profits growing? Yes. Okay. For Asian paints, it is. Okay. What about, sorry, indigo paints, it is. What about Asian paints? Is it, is this growing? Yes. It's not as if that it's going down. Is this growing? Yes. I have a profits. Okay. So is the business crap for Asian paints? The short answer is no. It's doing fine. Okay. Is the business good for indigo paints? The short answer is no. It is fine. And please note, I am not talking in terms of the price of the stock right now. I am not commenting on the price yet because this class is about judging asset quality. Okay. So we are doing part one first and then we can talk about price subsequently. Okay. Adani is entering everywhere. Man. Adani will enter into like, you know, stock market ports also the next time you take it to leave like Adani will, I don't know like so, what any. So like so bottom line being that you cannot worry about Adani. Right. So they will enter everywhere with that logic you should only buy Adani. Right. So like there's nothing that you can do then. Okay. So yeah. Okay. But yes, for example, Geofinance, should you have like a billionaire hedge or croonic capitalist or whatever you call it? Yes. Okay. So for example, if you're buying Vajaj finance also buy Geofinance. Okay. So yeah. So that's the so one nation two company. I'm like, so I think that can be done like signing as. Right. So bottom line being that don't worry about Adani and all. This will speak tomorrow that how to create like an Adani hedge or a money hedge. Right. That also is important. We have to be realistic. But won't price should fluctuate with profits. It should. But what should happen does not really happens in real life. Right. For example, if you study hard, it does not mean that you will get marks. You'll only get marks if you are like my wife and you know how to ace exams. I'm bad at it. Okay. And my wife scored like 98 marks or whatever like 100 marks and like maths. I scored like what is 7580 but finance I'm better. Okay. So like for example, Hindi, she scored like what 96 97% marks right. And you know Hindi bullwallow made send me the life say right. I can speak like Shuddindi. Right. And I should have I should sue CBSC. Okay. So while giving me like worst marks and my wife. Okay. But yeah, marks are not a different skill. And bull lines and different skill. Okay. So point being that don't worry about all these things that okay, stop profit right. So that should happen that it does not happen on one-on-one basis. Okay. But it broadly in the long term, it happens. Okay. I'll explain this also in the second half. Right. But let's complete the thought process. Right. This is a little bit boring class. But honestly, it's very important for you to understand these these salient points. Right. So okay. So anyways, I hope that this point is clear. What is the meaning of time? What is the meaning of mode? Right. So what is the mode of now? Let us just quickly do a quick exercise that what is the mode of HDFC bank? Okay. The mode of HDFC bank is regulation. Okay. I can I open HDFC bank or a bank similar to HDFC? The short answer is no. I can't. Okay. What is the mode of Noama? Well, okay. Noama. Well, okay. And to understand this, what you need to do is that see you go type read about the company that what is it? Not the company is doing. For example, Noama with what it does. It is breaking and equity. Okay. So here, then you need to figure out that does it have a narrow mode or a wide mode? Okay. So this is the conversation that you need to have. Now what is the meaning of a narrow mode? Narrow mean not narrow mode means it for example, when it comes to Zomato delivery business, food delivery business, that is a narrow mode. Okay. It also has a wide mode because it has other lines of businesses. Okay. When it comes to Asian paints, what is the narrow mode? It is its distribution network of paints. Does it have a wide mode yet? Is it interior business really big or not? Now, how do you get this data? So just simply go on publicity and type that and you just literally ask for a publicity. Okay. So now it is a very personal way life. I don't know why my internet is not working just a second. Okay. Okay. So we will show you publicity and you can see more in the question. So just simply go. Right. High brand equity. Now do you think that in paying to business brand matter? Yes. Maybe on a scale of 10, 10 being the 10 being really important. Maybe it matters under scale of six seven. Okay. Not at 10. For example, when it comes to Apple computers or computers, brand matters. When it comes to luxury watches, brand matters on 10 or 10. Okay. But here there is going to be that strong distribution network. So they have 25,000 dealers. Okay. This is huge. Operational efficiency. So what are they doing? They are working in a commodity business. The modest commodity business. Petrol Haridah, oil Haridah, right. And you do cost cutting and you manufacture it at best possible price. They have a lot of experience on this. Okay. Increased competition. But see, now here, this is again, emerging challenges. Increased competition is competition increasing? Yes. Is it a good sign? Yes and no. Why is it a good sign? Because you yourself think if paying to business was crap, why would like an adani's, you enter and all that? Right. I mean, because money is being made in this industry, therefore people are entering. Right. So it's common sense. Right. Important question to ask here is that can Asian paint survive the competition? Now, if revenue numbers and profit numbers are telling us that it is surviving, then it's fine. It's not a problem. Right. Rising cost. Now, is this
