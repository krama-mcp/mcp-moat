==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text is a fragmented discussion on investment strategies, focusing on markets like India, the US, and China. The speaker covers topics such as tax implications, shorting markets, diversification, index funds, and emerging trends like AI and semiconductor technology. Key themes include the inefficiency of shorting in India due to high taxes, the importance of diversification, and a preference for US stocks for tax benefits. The speaker also emphasizes data-driven investing, avoiding market predictions, and focusing on practical opportunities in the next 3-5 years rather than long-term speculative bets.  

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Shorting in India is impractical**: High short-term capital gains tax (20%) and lack of structured ETFs make shorting unattractive. Markets also trend upwards or sideways most of the time.  
- **Diversification is critical**: Emerging markets like India attract foreign investment (FIs) for diversification, even if allocations are small relative to larger economies.  
- **Tax efficiency drives US investments**: The speaker prioritizes US and UAE stocks for tax advantages while maintaining emerging market exposure via India.  
- **Avoid market timing**: Prognosis is futile; focus on current data and sensible entry/exit strategies (e.g., swing trading with clear plans).  
- **Index funds/ETFs are interchangeable**: The goal (e.g., owning Nifty 50) matters more than the vehicle (mutual fund or ETF).  
- **AI and tech opportunities are outside India**: Commercial AI applications are led by the US; India lacks near-term value in this space. Semiconductor and nuclear energy are long-term themes.  
- **Retail investors fuel markets**: Domestic Institutional Investors (DIs) rely on retail money, making retail the ultimate source of liquidity.  
- **Ignore outdated metrics**: Price-to-book (PB) and PEG ratios are less relevant than mastering P/E (price-to-earnings) analysis.  
- **Unpredictable policy impacts markets**: Government actions (e.g., interest rate changes, tax hikes) can cause sudden market swings.  
- **Investing is forward-looking**: Past performance (e.g., historical losses) is irrelevant; focus on current opportunities.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
. OK. So it's artificial. Right. It has to be kept alive. There is no other option. That's the biggest advantage. You know, we have that because we know that a secular decline is not going to come. We can always take advantage of these 10, 15% false. OK. How do you manage tax while rotating? See, it do be tax. I was up to the end here. I mean, for example, Indian government announced that we are going to suck your blood by charging you 50% times. You have to pay it. There is nothing that we can do. Right. So that is separate. Right. Everyone is paying tax. Is it true that if I aren't making enough alpha, that's why they are selling consistently? No. See, again, this is like a very wrong perception on things. OK. What I mean by this is that for example, Warren Buffett portfolio is $600 billion. How much do you think he's investing in India? Maybe like 10% of that. So it doesn't matter to him. He's anyways going to take like emerging market exposure. And within that exposure also is going to diversify. Right. So yeah, so to cut the long story short, our markets are very small. Right. And even if FIs across the world, for example, in China, Singapore, US, Europe, because their economies are so big, even if they have like 10% exposure outside their home countries and give 5% or 3% to India, that itself makes a very high percentage of our market as FIs money. OK. So only at a diversification plate. It's like me buying like real estate in Dubai, one real estate. OK. Majority of my real estate, holding it in Goa. I'm just buying it for diversification. So that's how I would put it. OK. So yeah. What price did you buy? HDP and I don't recall now. Good grief. I bought it like last year. I'll double check it. Let you know. It's QQQ. No. Yesterday I spoke about it. So today evening, I'll explain more. Index funds or ETF, which is seen. Now guys, I mean, don't micro manage things. Right. For example, many people get stuck. Yeah, okay. Nifty 50. Kareena should be by like mutual funder outside or ETF routes. By anything that you like. It doesn't matter. The end goal is to buy Nifty 50. Right. China market will it still keep on rising due to China's giving it looks like it. Right. So I mean, I had already invested in China and increased my portfolio exposure to somewhere around like 6% on China. Right. So my plan is to do 10. So let's see. US market. We have a specific class. So we'll do that. What is shorting the market? Shorting the market is that when you feel that the markets are going to fall. So then that's when you shot. Is it sensible for Indians to do it? No. Okay. Two reasons. One is that our short term capital gains is 20%. So it makes shorting strategy useless in India because you're being just too high attacks. Okay. Second is that majority of the times the markets are either in an upward momentum or sideways. So you're going to lose money. Right. So I would not recommend that you learn shorting the market in a market like India and also we don't have structured. ETFs through which you can short the market. Okay. So for example, in the US, if you want to short the US market, you can buy something called as inverse QQ, right. Now that allows you to short the market. But in India, you don't have such a product. Right. So it's complicated to short the Indian market. Okay. Why do you not start investing? Most of your money in either US or UA stocks and very less new money in Indian stock, tax benefit. Yes. That's precisely what I'm doing. I'm investing most of my new money in US stocks. Okay. And UA. Right. Right. So I have like tax advantage. Right. So like that's what I would recommend to NRIs also. Right. And. But I still need to have like an emerging market exposure. So for me, that's India because I understand the market really well. Right. So I have experience of investing in this market. India for my emerging markets. Right. Tax loss harvesting. I'll write a short note. Okay. See, it's not like swing trade up. Neeker. Right. The point is that for example, I'm a very clear exit plan for nifty. Right. For example, whatever bulk I have done, right. I mean, in fact, I bought it even cheaper. Right. I bought it here. Right. The market. Right. And. This is like a very clear exit point. Now, I don't know if this exit point will be attained. For example, this exit point. It might happen here. It might happen here. It might happen here. It might happen here. Now, whenever it happens, I'm going to exit some of my this trade that I've taken. Okay. So this is this for me swing trade. It that's how I define swing trade. Okay. I've invested 30 lakhs since last time I'm standing at a two percent. Should I sell everything and start if I see this is pointless. Right. How much profit or loss you're having right now. Okay. Investing is an everyday affair. Right. So for example, today market is available 10 11% cheap. Does it make sense to put your new money into the market right now? Whatever has happened in the history is useless. Right. For example, I was the 10th one when I was 99% marks. I think now you're 35 years old. Why are you talking about your 10th word exam? It doesn't make sense. Okay. So like life has changed. Right. So similarly, whatever investment you have done in the past, it's done. Right. So let's leave it. Right. So start afresh. Good website. It's evening. I'll show you. Okay. So you should look at P. You should not look at P. Okay. So you should ignore P. Okay. Important important thing to notice P. E ratio. You should not even look at price. Okay. Waiting for swing trading. Yes. I'll I'll do it. Okay. So yeah. Okay. So I'll do it. Okay. So I'll do it. Okay. Okay. So I'll do it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. So yeah. Indian market got out of. I don't know. Like so. It's very hard to say. Right. For example, let's say tomorrow Indian government comes and announces that we are cutting interest rate. Then the market will run like anything. Okay. Unexpectedly. And tomorrow if Indian government says that you know what? What? What? What? You know, when you talk about right pay 30 percent LTCG. What do you think is going to happen? Right. So then suddenly the market will crash. So it's beyond me. Right. So it will not. This is not something that we can prepare for. Right. So therefore prognosis is useless. Right. You look at data. For example, today you are getting something cheap. What strategy you can build to invest. Sensibly you build that. You execute it and you move on. Right. And you will consistently as a money as a system will make money. Right. So that's what we are interested in. Unlisted stocks. I will speak separately. Right. I will do that. Trending. You should we go for paid. No. Use free. No. I'm using it. I'm using it. I'm using it. I'm using it. I'm using it. I'm using it. I'm using it. I'm using it for free. Okay. Say. Who buys when both FI and DIs. That's the point. Retail people do not have that kind of money. Right. So therefore when FI sell, DIs have to buy as compulsion. Okay. But an interesting question is that how do DIs get money to buy? Right. From you. Okay. So ultimately it's retail who is buying. Right. So at the end of the day. DIs are nothing but a collection of retail money. Right. Investment idea. I'll do an unlisted class. Right. This kind of retrouve. This kind ofnaire system and defense. Because it is the same. That's the same. Three years for deputy to recover. Boozed that mean four five annual returns. But you're buying the market cheat too. And from the top it should give returns. Because you'll always outs felt like returns off. And there for us is you mean 90% right? So they're also conservatively you are making like 12, 13% which is the average. you are 그다음에 that is one state or senior. So which is okay. So, which makes the market in Vestable. right when to exit from a trade this I'll explain right appreciate one good treat okay what is AI scenario and investment that technology has evolved with data churning what's happening see commercial applications will be made there are certain proven commercial applications that will come for example autonomous cars will come there will be a lot of gene editing for example CRISPR technology that is going to pick up it is going to get commercialized over time these are high-ticket items to consider right semi conductor it will definitely evolve like I mean get better with time right because you require more computational power nuclear energy is again a very good 10 year 15 year theme but I don't do like that type of investing where I'm thinking 15 years just tell me like whatever is good in the next 3 to 5 years I'll rather focus my attention there AI I don't see any value in India right now because we are not going to lead the race in commercial application of AI as of now okay you know it's a evolving field even I don't know everything so but you know right now the opportunities are there in US and not in India okay I'll try to do that okay how to decide what percentage to sell once you target we have a separate selling class do you use PB for understanding entry level not really right PB only works for companies that are where the book value makes sense for example ports okay technically their book value kind of makes sense right because that's an asset it's a very high capital intensive asset okay business right and public sector companies with the brand values not that great right but honestly PB is a very old ratio it does not make sense okay so same with peg it's not required just understand P learn how to use P really well and you will be mostly good to go UAE stocks are not covered on this course course right I mean this course is already like you know very extensive on Indian stocks but maybe I'll make like some public video or something right you always mentioned buying Nifty and you elaborate different between Nifty Nifty same thing right so Nifty B's is an ETF Nifty 50 is the instrument team so it's one and th
