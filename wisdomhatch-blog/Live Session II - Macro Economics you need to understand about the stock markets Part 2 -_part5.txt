==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text discusses investment analysis, emphasizing the importance of understanding market valuations and avoiding overvalued assets. The speaker highlights uncertainties in sectors like IT, where future prospects are unclear, and advises against investing in areas with high P/E ratios (e.g., small caps, some IT stocks). They stress the role of liquidity in driving bull markets but caution against blindly investing in overvalued assets. The speaker also critiques SIPs (Systematic Investment Plans) as irrational unless adjusted for market conditions (step-up/down SIPs). Finally, they underscore that investing preserves wealth but building wealth requires skill development and hard work, especially for younger individuals.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. **Uncertainty in Investing**: It’s okay to admit ignorance (e.g., future of IT in India) and avoid investing in unclear sectors.  
2. **Valuation Matters**:  
   - Overvalued sectors (e.g., small caps, some IT stocks) may correct; undervalued sectors (e.g., banks) offer better opportunities.  
   - P/E ratios help assess valuations (e.g., TCS may be fairly valued now, but baseline P could drop if growth slows).  
3. **Liquidity Drives Markets**: Long-term liquidity growth (globally) supports asset price appreciation, but selective investing is key.  
4. **Market Timing**: Adjust investments based on valuations (e.g., step-up SIP in downturns, pause in overvalued markets).  
5. **Critique of SIPs**: Blind SIPs are flawed; strategic adjustments (step-up/down) align better with market conditions.  
6. **Wealth Building**: Investing preserves wealth, but skills and hard work are essential to grow income (especially for young earners).  
7. **Structural Challenges**: India’s manufacturing sector faces hurdles (high costs, labor shortages), limiting export gains.  
8. **Diversification**: Access to multiple asset classes ensures opportunities even if markets shift (e.g., India/US valuations may flip).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
s. And third type of index comes at an comes where you can say that I don't know index. Okay. So for example, it index. I don't know what the future prospects of it in India is. And it is completely okay to say I don't know because when you don't know, you'll not invest. Okay. And when you don't invest, you don't give a shit about that. Right. So that's the bottom line. Now, can I am I like some kind of Yankee who can tell you what exactly is going to be the future of it in India? No, I don't know. My estimate is that you know what things look bad. Maybe like I mean the competitive advantage for Indian IT was that, you know, it used to hire cheap manpower and there used to be human labor advantage. But can I be sure that you know, something like let's say, Info says TCS and all that it will continue to trade at its baseline P. For example, if I show you baseline P of something like TCS. Okay. Now, what is a baseline P here? Now the baseline P is this dotted line that you see, right? It was around like maybe this is the last, what do you think 2728? This is a baseline P. And in context of its earning, it is still a little bit high. Right. So at most, you can call it like fairly valued assessment, which cause them near right. I mean, and it what might happen is that if the growth rate of the entire IT sector in India goes down, then this baseline P itself will come down. Okay. Instead of having like a baseline P of 25, it might become 15 who knows why because it might be a slow growth industry. Okay. Very similar to how, for example, there is always like after every 20 years, top companies, John, at one point in time, Ford Motors was one of the most valuable companies in the world. Then it was replaced by tech. Okay. Within tech, right? I mean, there were like companies like Dell, Adobe and all that. They got replaced by like M7s now. Okay. Netflix, what not there in the M7 Tesla was not there in M7 before 2019. Then they became like top M7 companies in the US in India. That might happen that IT companies are like top companies in India right now, top 1015 companies. Will it forever remain? I don't know if the fundamentally things change that might not happen. Okay. So I'm just giving you a flavor of how to analyze all these things. Right. It's not as if that you require a PhD to study these points. Tomorrow we'll delve deeper into PE ratios, different types of ratios, just quickly summarizing whatever we studied today. Right. From a macro economics point of view, right? That see in a bull market. Sorry. In a bull market, there is going to be bull market happens because there is more liquidity in the system. Right now, if we step back and see will the liquidity increase in the world. On a long term basis, the short answer is yes. Right. Your up is increasing liquidity. China is increasing liquidity. US keeps on increasing liquidity. India too will increase liquidity. As a result, there will be a price up the position. Therefore, we should invest in stocks. Okay. Now, should we invest in every single thing that is out there? No. For example, if we study small cap index, it still looks overvalued. Right. If we study companies like Trent, D-Mart, there is still a very high chance of PE correction. If we study some index, which are uncertain index, for example, IT. Now, this is an opinion. I don't know. I'm myself telling you. I don't know. My British that it will correct. Right. Now, I can be off. When it comes to banks, they are at somewhat fair value. If you look at or undervalued rather, if we look at nifty broad, it is somewhat fairly valued. If we look at NASDAQ, it is somewhat overvalued. So the point is that at any given point in time, this is, you will always have investment options. It's not as if that six months down the line. It will remain the same. It might happen that six months down the line, Indian market will become overvalued. US market will become undervalued or unlisted will become undervalued. Something of this sort. So the more access to investment, you're never you have easier life, your life becomes. This is the central key takeaway that I will give because generally, you will make money because asset prices will appreciate with time. The only thing is that as long as your entry point on different assets is good, you will make money. For example, many people in Dubai right now are thinking that was the way real estate market is like hitting the top. Okay. So I'll wait and then I'll buy is that the right decision, wrong decision. I'll not comment because that's a conversation in itself. But this is like a viewpoint. Right. So what you're trying to do is that you're trying to intelligently tying the market. You need to do that on stocks also at least not on the entire stock market, but at least on certain assets. Every one with me, okay, enjoy the class today. Cool. Awesome. So this is where we'll close this. I'll take some questions right from the chat. I'll start first and then we will take some questions from the call also. I'll start with the washish question. Major private banks are nearing their all time high. That's still a good entry point, but all time high on what basis? There's a five year time correction that has happened. Right. So for example, if I show you the data, it is like you said like a codec, right? So codec if you take a look. So here is codec, right? Here is price, right? Is it all time high? Yes. But all time high was here also almost right? So 1960 in 2020 here, it is 2000, right? So hardly anything has changed and five years price. Okay. So this is a five year time correction that has happened. Interestingly, right? I mean, for example, I'm just trying to check at what PE it used to trade right here. And tomorrow, I'll explain you the concept of P. So you'll get more. Okay. What is the meaning of P? So for example, if you go here, the P of codec, mind Ramak was 44. Okay. Right now it is available at a P of 21, okay? Which means that just through P expansion, if it goes back to its previous P. It will double in value. Okay. So what is a fair price of P to mind Ramak? We don't know, right? But it is definitely undervalued. Yeah. Okay. IT Farmer is export having said this. USD growth will benefit in terms of repeat appreciation. We only benefit in terms of repeat appreciation. If we are able to export well, if you are not able to export well, then it's useless. Okay. Now what is the meaning of exporting well? It means that we have the capability of creating high quality products in context of the price. For example, if we can't even manufacture holy ki pitch curry and we end up buying Chinese holy ki pitch curry, then what good manufacturing are we doing to be honest, right? So it makes no sense, right? So there are structural issues in manufacturing. There is a reason why we have like 2, 3% manufacturing growth rate. And this is not just me saying a lot of economists have also said the same thing. And there are structural issues in manufacturing, right? And if you speak with like small business owners in India who are into manufacturing, you yourself will be able to understand their pain. Why India is a very difficult market to manufacture? Because cost of power is very expensive. Almost every manufacturing unit requires our land is very expensive because you require land. Labor is very expensive. And you put like gift subsidy, right? Or if you give like you know 70, 80% percent, like 60% of our population free food grain and all that, it kills the incentive for many to work, right? Try finding labor, right? For like I wrote a tweet also on this topic. That if you are in states like Goa, etc., try finding labor, right? For gardening, garbage collection, etc. You'll have a nightmare, right? I mean, it's very complicated to find labor. They don't want to work, right? I mean, that's the problem, okay? Okay. What are the signs of a market fall overvaluation? That's like literally number one reason why market will fall, okay? NSC unless literature should be by I will buy, okay? So I'll try to separate note. Will you cover more on entry point? Yes, I'll cover. BSE is good. Please wait for a note, okay? Why SIPs don't work? Are you an example with number C? I don't get the logic of SIP, right? I mean, basically you should buy something because it is a good investment, okay? Every time you are money, for example, it's like saying that every month you should buy a shirt. Why? Okay? If the shirt is on a discount, if you need a shirt, if it is solving some goal for you, then you should do it, okay? But randomly buying like, for the heck of it does not make sense, okay? Buying at whatever levels is a bad strategy, okay? So like maybe I'll try to cover it with an example, right? But just generally, right? And see if you don't know anything, then it's fine, just, you know, invest. But a better approach would be to step up or step down SIP. For example, right now the market is 10% down. So do a step up SIP, invest more. If the market is at an all time high and you are seeing that it is somewhat in the overvalued category, wait for two, three ones, don't do SIP. So that is called a step down SIP, right? And that's logical, right? Consumer visa is good, not a problem, right? 50K, nine, what should you advise people like me? I'm 26, making about 50, see, for at 26, 50K is not a bad salary to be honest, right? Work on skills, right? I mean, when you're young, you have a lot of time. The more skills you have, the more money making opportunities you have in life, right? So focusing on skills is very important. Investing and broad investing, investing it through you'll not get rich. Investing is a great way of protecting wealth. Investing is not a way to sort of make millions, billions and all that stuff. You require sweat, capital, right? So you have to work hard, you have to have skills and then only you can grow, right? From that, but yes, there is a significant disadvantage of not inve
