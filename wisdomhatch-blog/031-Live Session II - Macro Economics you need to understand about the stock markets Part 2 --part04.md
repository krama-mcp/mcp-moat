SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses investment strategies, emphasizing the importance of picking high-growth stocks over struggling large-cap manufacturers. They highlight examples of Indian entrepreneurs venturing into finance (e.g., Navi, Geo Finance) and stress the significance of timing entries in the stock market using technical analysis (e.g., buying at support levels). The speaker warns against overpaying for assets, using high P/E ratios (e.g., D-Mart, Trent) as examples, and contrasts undervalued indices (e.g., private banks) with overvalued ones (e.g., small-cap indices). They advocate for a disciplined approach to entry points and differentiate between investing (long-term) and swing trading (short-term).

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Focus on High-Growth Stocks:** Prioritize sectors like finance over struggling large-cap manufacturing.  
- **Entry Timing Matters:** Money is made at entry, not exit; use technical analysis (e.g., support levels) to time purchases.  
- **Avoid Overpaying:** High P/E ratios (e.g., 935 for D-Mart) signal overvaluation and potential price corrections.  
- **Index Valuation:** Undervalued indices (e.g., private banks) offer better opportunities than overvalued ones (e.g., small-cap indices at 200% returns).  
- **Swing Trading vs. Investing:** Trade sideways-correcting assets short-term; invest in undervalued assets long-term.  
- **P/E Context Matters:** Price corrections can continue if P/E ratios contract, even after significant drops.  
- **Discipline is Key:** Stick to buying quality assets at reasonable valuations, avoiding "buy at any price" strategies.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 a large cap manufacturer? Right? If you know that they are struggling. You would pick high growth stocks. Let me put it another way. If you pick some of the smartest entrepreneurs in India, for example, just say Sachin Bansal, mini Bansal, who build Flipkart. What are the building next? Navi. Okay? What type of app is Navi finance? Okay? What is Isha Mane doing? Geo finance. Okay? What is Nathan Gamath, Nikhil Gamath doing finance? What is Vijay Shikar Sharma doing finance? Where money will be made finance? Karna Math. Okay? So that's all you need to do. Okay? So manufacturing, curling and making India, curling and no, I'll do it. I mean, there's no point. Okay? I end up doing that. Okay? So I hope everyone is kind of. When are we doing these modemota analysis? Okay? So I hope that this point is clear to everyone. Okay? So, so this this point is clear to everyone. Okay? All right. So now, if you don't do this modemota analysis, then what happens? Okay? So what will happen is that you will have massive form. Okay? If you don't buy it here, for example, here, technicals tell us to buy. Right? Technicals, how to do technical analysis that I will teach you like next week. Right? But Abhi Halvel Algaly, like I've just imagined that, okay, this is the type of charting that you can do. Right? How to do this? This I will tell you subsequently. I'll give you some homework to watch some of my videos. But this is called as support. So you buy at support. Okay? If you have to invest 100 rupees on nifty bank, at least 60 should be done right now. Okay? 60, 65. Now, if it falls here, should you buy more? Yes. Buy another 20%. If it falls here, buy another 20%. Done. Okay? If it falls more, nothing. Just wait. Okay? It's not as if that banks in India will go to zero. No. Like, I mean, you're buying an index. Okay? So it's not as if that index will go to zero, like reliance calm. Okay? So I hope that this point is clear. Right? So, entry point becomes really good. Okay? And money is made at the time of entry. Money is not made at the time of exit. Okay? What do you have? Once I have to time the exit. But most of your money will be made. If you are buying a good quality asset at a good price. Okay? But if you buy a really good asset, which is called as Bob strategy, buy at any price. That's a very bad strategy. Right? Marsalis one has proven that it's not it doesn't work. So don't buy at any price. It doesn't work. Right? So it's significantly over pay. Okay? For example, D-Mart. Okay? Now, we will do a separate case study on D-Mart. Right? But here. Right? Ah. No. Okay. So here we are. Right? D-Mart. Okay. Okay. But other e-mail. Right? So for example, this stock trades at 935 P. Now, what does a meaning of 935 P? I'll teach you P ratio tomorrow. Okay? But 935 P means, for example, Amazon. If you just go and ask. Now, Amazon P.E. Airways. So you will see that Amazon P. I think it's a little bit of the kind of Amazon P ratio. No, you don't. Oh, this is something again. This Amazon ink P.E. Airways. Okay. Now, this looks a little bit weird. I'll double check it. Okay. I don't think that this is correct. Okay. Hmm. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. That box. Nice running. Okay. Let me seek. Okay. Okay. Do it. This is another website. I'm just double checking it. It looks a little bit off. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Nice. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Let me take this off. Okay. Okay. Okay. That's it. Okay. Then. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Am I not able to do it? Share data. Okay, next time I'll just search for it, but I don't think that this is correct. But anyways, like come in, what was the example that I was trying to give? Yes, I was trying to give the example of FSN, right? So 935 PE is like very, very high. Okay. So I mean, even if you don't understand much about P, it is crazy amount. So two, tomorrow I'll explain in detail what is the meaning of P, some ratios, etc. But for the timing, right? I mean, if the company keeps on, if the company and growth rate, right? For example, if the company is growing at a very high growth rate, for example, you can find the growth rate here. So on a five year basis, the company has grown at a 27% growth rate of profits. Okay. Even for this, this is very high. Okay. So deem it, I'll tell you how I am. Right? So I have a new supermod. This is at 93 PE, right? If you look at peers, okay? So for example, you will see it trend 123, right? And trend, if you look at stock, right? So if you go here, you take a look at the stock price. So it was trading at 8000. It has gotten corrected by almost 40%. And yet its PE remains at 123. So what is happening on this stock? A PE correction is happening on a stock. Okay. Usually typically, like even good companies should like large caps. So this is a large cap company. And large cap companies, PE should not typically be more than like 5060. If you are paying more than 5060, it's typically like dangerous to pay. So sometimes companies undergo like massive price correction. Okay. Now I brought this in context of price correction on individual assets, individual stocks. Okay. And just say if we go to here, right? Now here, there is no PE risk per se. Okay. So for example, if you take a look at nifty bank index, now there is no like, I don't think I'll find the collective PE of nifty bank ETF. And ETF will find a code tech, nifty bank, take care. Yes, I can find. Okay. Because these assets are like recently constructed. So they don't have a PE, right? That's a problem, right? So anyways, but you can ballpark the PE. Okay. So for example, if you go to codec bank, okay, codec mind, the bank. And here you will find the P of codec mind, the bank. Okay. Now here is PE ratio. What you will notice is that this is available at a P of 21. Okay. Similarly, if you go to HDFC bank, right? Because these banks are the ones that are making the, the private bank index. This is available at 1920. At one point in time, this was available at 1617 PE. Okay. What I'm trying to tell you is that see the chances of here, there is a chance of PE expansion. Okay. On something like Dmart. Trent. Though the stock is corrected, okay. But it can correct further because the PE is contracting. Okay. So this is a very important point that we always look at price. Looking at prices useless. Okay. We should price should always be seen in context of its earning. And that is a meaning of PE ratio. For example, a stock that is corrected by 30, 40%. Can still correct more if it undergoes further PE correction. For example, Dmart. Trent. Okay. Now I'm not saying that it will definitely happen. But if we just try to understand that C boss, go take my name, the bank HDFC, bank gets available at 1819 P. Is there or KBE two? Take a right. So it's not as if that it will group become like public sector banks type. Okay. There is some efficiency there. Right. So therefore, like I mean, there is a higher chance that it will. Not how to determine the correct V tomorrow. We have a class. Okay. So they're there. I'll explain you some concepts around that. But Motamoda, what I'm trying to tell you is very simple that when it comes to like, you know, our job in the stock market is to find out a very good point of entry. And if you are doing it in index level, there is usually not a bad index. There are three types of indices. There is an undervalued index. For example, private bank index is undervalued. Okay. Second could be a fairly valued index. For example, or sorry, an overvalued index, just a small cap to 50. If you go and study small cap to 50, what you will notice is this. Right. So for example, let's go small cap to 50. Yeah. Now here, for example, between here to here, small cap gave 115% run up in a single year. Okay. Now if you judge it from 2020, right, it had given 250% run up. Okay. For context, 250% run up. I'm looking at it till here because this was a selling point. Okay. Now, 260% run up. Now typically, how much would a small cap index give in a year around 20, 21%. So in five, where it should give, given you maybe like 120%, but it was sitting at 260%. So was it a cell? Yes. Now, how would you quickly like do motor, motor, math and figure out? Is it undervalued or not? So you look at it here, right? So right now it is at 200% in five years. Okay. How much would it typically be? Maybe like 140, 150%. So is it overvalued still? Yes. So I'll not buy it. Okay. So right now, I'll not buy it. Okay. So when will I buy it? Maybe like after maybe two years, it goes sideways or whatever, then I will add it. Okay. So here, chances of a sideways correction is very high. Right. Still, it might not correct in price, but it might correct in time. Everyone is understanding the concept of time correction. Okay. So time correction means that for example, here, right. It might not happen that it may be it falls still here and then it consolidates in this range. Okay. And when you do this analysis that you start comparing this index from here to this point, then it might make sense. Okay. Boss. Okay. Fine. Right. Almost like this is 2028. Right. And it is at a CAGR of 20% now. Is it a good time to enter here? Yes. Okay. If you enter here, you will make money. But if you enter here, you might not make money. If you enter here, you will make money. If you enter here, you might make money. So then it's not as if that you don't invest in this index. But you invest on this index with the goal of trading. Okay. Swing trading means that by low sell. Okay. Everyone is getting swing trading. We do on assets that will go sideways. Okay. Just say what do you all private banks? Right. I don't think that there is going to be a sideways correction much on it. It's at a swing trading or at an investible stage. So similarly, you will have different different assets, which are in these different zone
