SUMMARY:
The text discusses key indicators for evaluating investment-worthy companies, focusing on shareholder benefits, profit siphoning risks, and management incentives. It highlights red flags like promoters misusing company funds (e.g., lavish spending) and contrasts cyclical industries (e.g., sugar stocks) with stable businesses. Examples include Vedanta’s dividend controversies and public-sector salary disparities (e.g., SBI vs. HDFC Bank). The analysis also covers corporate strategies like stock buybacks (Apple) to stabilize share prices during downturns and critiques Google’s current valuation drop due to ad revenue risks. The speaker advocates understanding corporate finance fundamentals to spot opportunities during market corrections.

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Shareholder Benefits Matter**: Companies should prioritize passing profits to shareholders; avoid those where promoters siphon funds (e.g., excessive dividends, personal luxuries).  
- **Red Flags in Cyclical Industries**: Businesses like sugar stocks face cycles where promoters may sell/pillage assets during peaks, exposing investors to volatility.  
- **Management Incentives**: Low executive pay (e.g., SBI) can misalign goals with shareholder interests, unlike performance-driven private-sector CEOs.  
- **Stock Buybacks as a Tool**: Companies like Apple use cash reserves to buy back shares during dips, artificially supporting prices and buying time for recovery.  
- **Market Correction Opportunities**: Identify oversold stocks (e.g., Google) with strong balance sheets that can weather downturns, but assess long-term viability.  
- **Incentive Structures Matter**: Align investments with firms where leadership is financially motivated to grow shareholder value (e.g., HDFC Bank vs. SBI).

 So here we are getting two positive signals. One negative maybe, and one question mark. So based on this, you have to make a call. So you have to do this analysis for all 1718 points, and then sort of reach that conclusion. Passes of benefits to shareholders. Now what is the meaning of this? Now there are some companies. For example, there is a case study that I've done. It is on Vedanta. Please search Akshat Vedanta. And you will understand how exactly like promoters, promoters bought their own equity when the stock was down. And took money away in the form of dividends. So I'll not repeat that logic here. It's a little bit complicated logic. I've already made like a 20, 25 minute video on it. So in case you're interested in understanding that story, please don't. OK, from that. But what I will tell you is, and these are stories that you would have heard that for example, your friend is running a startup. He got like VC funding. Then he bought a Mercedes for his company. And then he roams around in that Mercedes. Now that's wasting investors money in a way. Similarly, if many VC found very funded startup guys, they live only in Oberoi's. And all that on like their investors money. Now that is, now whenever they are doing this, what are they doing? They're eventually reducing the profits of their company, because the company is paying for it. And that profit needs to be given to us. They colder or investors. It's the end of the day. So that is the red flag. Now does that happen in public markets also? Yes. Now you cannot go around like an hour. Because you have what like HUL store. So you'll stand in front of like HUL CEO's office and monitor his movements. And you'll see if he's taking on Mercedes or not. You cannot do all that. So you can't do that. But generally like there are certain industries where this profit siphoning off happens quite aggressively. For example, sugar stocks. Because many of you get excited to sugar stocks are dealing with this. That stuff. So for example, let's look at Balrampur, Genie. So this is a Genie mill or sugar mill. And what you will see is basically very cyclical nature of this business. For example, this is a negative cycle. This is a positive cycle. This is again another cycle. Phase one is two, phase three. This is another cycle going on. Now why is it like on the other hand, if you take a look at a dual type of businesses, they will go like up like this. So why do we have like this variation? Because what happens is that see, for example, this guy would have waited for like, you know, whatever like 10 years in the cycle. That he would be owning like 99% of his company or whatever. And then it went through a bad cycle. A lot of debt, a lot of headache, people running after him, come to me, a pass office, for over and all that. So he went through a lot of shit for like 10 years, 10, 15 years. Then there was some bullishness, that he would all branding. Okay, so Ethan all branding will do. Now suddenly sugar stocks start running because investors like sheep, they run after like a lot of things. His stocks went up in price. What do you think he will do? He'll say, you have a bit of a pass, I'll lay low. Okay, so that's a simple point. Right? If you're going to do something, he's going to sell some of his stocks. Right? A lot of his stocks or he's going to pledge it. Okay. So pledge it means that he will borrow against his stocks. Or his because his company value has gone up. Baluations of the company was 200 crores suddenly. It became like 1600 crores due to Ethanol branding. He'll buy like five Mercedes. Mola, yeah, yeah, Bada. Right. I don't know when the next down cycle will come. Because today they are giving me Ethanol branding. My stocks have gone up tomorrow. They will come and start demanding like 28% GST on sugar. And bullying a guy, sugar, sugar, so 38% GST. So if you know, at the end, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're, we're 28% GST. So right? So there's no barossa. So I'll just buy five Mercedes. At least my family will be safe. Okay. So that is what he will do. Okay. So that's what ends up happening on these type of cyclical stocks. Okay. Another. So this is an incentive problem in some companies. For example, SBI chairman. Now, SBI is the biggest bank in India. What is SBI's chairman's salary versus HDFC banks CEO salary? Huge difference. Okay. So for example, SBI chairman might be making less money than I would. Okay. So not kidding. So which is absolutely like pathetic. Okay. So now what incentive does he have to like, you know, sort of work in investors favor. Okay. So for this, you need to understand incentive problem. That what is the goal of a CEO? Like for example, if you're an American CEO, where America, American company Google, for example, it's undergoing like drama right now. That a lot of like stock correction is happening all that stuff. And what do you think like is the pressure on Sundar Pichai right now? BVB, I bought me business. I gave a lot of it. It's the simple point is that stock price should not fall. Why because if the stock price falls, investors are taking a loss. And then they will tell the board that you know what he's an idiot CEO fire him because he can't keep the company up in protecting shareholder's wealth is the number one goal of running a corporation. Okay. In America, this is literally said right. So I mean, for example, this was a question. I was in my corporate finance class when I was at NC art and like very famous guy. He used to teach us right hand. Basically, he has written a book called as blue ocean strategy right. So when you might have read that book right. So and this was the first thing that he told which kind of makes made a lot of sense to me also that okay, you know what? Okay, fine. And for example, like Apple right. I'll tell you the story of Apple here. So for example, if you go look at Apple. Okay. So here is Apple. It is going through 100 different problems right now. Warren Buffett. It's biggest shareholder. So Apple stock. When did he sell it? He sold it. Warren Buffett sold it somewhere here. Okay. So he exited apples somewhere here. Okay. After that, Apple fell like 10, 15 percent or 17, 18 percent right here. Another gear up. And since then it has run up. Now why has it run up in this zone? In this zone. This is called a corporate buybacks. Okay. That the company will go and buy its own stocks. Okay. Now as I explained that if the supply demand that is what determines the stock price right. So Warren Buffett sold Apple. Okay. So one supply increased right. And was not buying Apple again. But what did the company do? So Apple itself bought Apple here. Okay. So it raised the demand. Okay. So it did not fall much. Okay. Now how could now how did Apple buy this? Because it already had like you know billions of dollars sitting on their balance sheet. From which it would buy its own stock. Everyone in the understanding. Okay. Now even the more funny part I'll tell you right. Many people say you know, Zomato. Ne. For those money like from investors and they do have a heavy and they are making more money from this business. Then running their poor business is this true. Yes. Is this a problem? No. It's a problem of people who don't understand corporate finance. Okay. What is a fund higher? Okay. See, when do you think like I mean, for example, during like 2020 crash interest rate went to 0.25%. Who do you think borrowed money? For arms like Apple. What did they do? They build this cash reserves for what? For handling exactly situations like these right that if a big ticket investor leaves us. There is market panic. We ourselves can go and become like a l i c of our own company that we will my R's by our own stocks. And some what save it. Okay. So we might think that you know what business is going down Apple brand is coming down and you know people and on that excited to buy like Apple laptop. No product great product line inside. It's a temporary problem right it gives company some time to at least handle the situation. Now can they forever keep on buying their own stocks? No, they will run out of money. Okay. But at least for the timing they are able to do that right for at least like three four years they can survive and that's the game. Okay. How can you apply this knowledge? Okay. Very simple right. So right now US market is correcting right quite aggressively. I'm buying heavily. Okay. Now. At least I'll bring up like my portfolio to 50 60% of my intended amount go look at Google. Okay. So what is the issue with Google right for example here. This is the channel trading channel of Google. Okay. This is broken it's trading channel. It has fallen by roughly 24 25% from its peak. If you go and ask analyst why is it that Apple is sorry Google is following what will be the answer that actually the yourself are using complexity. Well, you're not even using Google Google is shit. Yes, I agree. Okay. So it's crap right on on that that you know and they are going to lose almost 67% of their advertisement revenue comes from. Sorry 67% of company revenue comes from advertisement right primarily driven by search right. So a major part of their business has gotten hit right. So therefore there is a 25% correction. How do you think how much do you think this maximum correction will be I'll say 40% right because Amazon had fallen like around 3540. So I do like one more bulk. Sit tight. What's my hope that will Google go back to its like golden days. I don't know. Okay, but are they setting on back massive balance sheet to buy their own stocks. Yes. Now this is like insightful points that you should know. So there is a high probability that you'll make money on that. So I hope everyone gets it. Okay. So. Okay. So passes of
