SUMMARY:
The text discusses key financial metrics and investment principles, focusing on Return on Capital (ROC), Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC), and how they influence investment decisions. It emphasizes that mature companies should have an ROC higher than their WACC (typically 12% in India) to be viable investments, with 13-14% as a minimum threshold. The analysis also covers the importance of economies of scale for smaller companies, the superiority of ROC over Return on Equity (ROE), and the need to avoid cyclical businesses unless timing the market correctly. Additionally, it highlights red flags in companies (e.g., corporate governance issues, excessive PR by founders) and the critical role of EPS and PE expansion in stock growth. Examples like Indigo Paints, Zomato, and Noama Wealth are used to illustrate these points.

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **ROC vs. WACC**: A mature companyâ€™s ROC should exceed its WACC (e.g., 12% in India); below 13-14% is a red flag.  
- **Economies of Scale**: Smaller companies (e.g., Indigo Paints) can improve ROC as they scale, reducing costs and borrowing expenses.  
- **ROC > ROE**: ROC (return on capital, including debt and equity) is a better metric than ROE (return on equity alone).  
- **Avoid Cyclical Businesses**: These require precise timing due to volatile profitability (e.g., telecom sectors with government penalties).  
- **Red Flags**: Corporate governance issues, excessive founder PR, or unexplained losses warrant exiting the investment.  
- **EPS and PE Expansion**: Stocks with growing EPS and rationalizing PE (e.g., Zomato) offer potential upside; declining EPS is risky.  
- **Industry Growth**: Companies like Noama Wealth benefit from macroeconomic trends (e.g., more Indians investing in equities).  
- **Qualitative Factors**: Management integrity and industry trends are as crucial as quantitative metrics.  
- **Accepting Losses**: Not all stocks will succeed; cutting losses early is key to long-term portfolio success.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
hould be avoided. Okay. So this is the only key takeaway that I will give from this particular note that if a mature company's ROC is lower than its vac, right. And you assume that WACC for most companies in India will be 12%. Okay. This is the barrier that they need to beat. Okay. So therefore we are saying that at least 14 though. Now, okay. So 1314 is the absolute minimum that should be the case. Okay. So I hope this this point is clear. For when it comes to a smaller company, for example, Indigo paints. Okay. Now here the ROC is only 23.2. Now you'll say that occasion paints is having 37 point something, right. In the same industry here it is 23.2. Should I ignore this? No. Because what is the meaning here? See, Indigo paints might be manufacturing stuff this much. Okay. Now as it manufactures this much, there will be economies of scale. You might have heard that in like your economics class when you were a kid that as for example, if you're making just one table up in a wider clear car painter comes to your house and you get one bed made. But if you get five bedmates together, then the overall cost comes down. So that is called as economies of scale. Okay. So I hope that this point is clear to everyone, right. That for a smaller form, usually the WACC will improve, right. Because it's manufacturing will improve. It's marketing spent overall as a percentage of its revenues will come down as the revenues go up. It's borrowing cost itself will go down. Okay. Yeah. ROE is a car. I'm not put because ROE is just return on equities. Okay. So equity is a type of a capital. ROC is return on capital employed. Capital includes both equity and debt. So ROC is a better matrix compared to ROE. Okay. Everyone gets it. Okay. So therefore ROC, otherwise like I mean, if you just again, the goal is not to become an accountant. Okay. So the goal is to absorb this information, sensibly, right. I hope this point is clear to everyone. Right. The only thing or the only key takeaway and that I'll give from gift for US, there are certain businesses where the ROC just does not make sense in context of WACC. So you can eliminate them altogether. Right. For example, just a birthday at it. Okay. So here's like barely hitting right 13.1. So this is like borderline. Okay. Now it's a cyclical business. Right. So I'll talk about tomorrow what cyclical businesses are and when should you buy them. But as a general rule, right, you cannot buy these type of businesses on our five 10 year basis and just stay put. It makes no sense. Right. For example, even from a stock price of point of view, what you will notice is that it goes like this. Okay. So here is the stock it keeps on going like this. If you buy it here, you'll make money after four years, like four years, you'll make zero returns. So therefore, you're entry timing on these type of stocks is critical. Why? Because the business does not expand, right. They will make money for four years. Then government will come, give me my cut. Right. Here is spectrum 6G. Give me money. Otherwise, you are screwed. Right. So they give them crores. Okay. And all the profits are taken away. Okay. So yeah. So that's a problem. Okay. So you can't do anything on that. Right. So I hope this point is clear. Okay. Now next point, no red flags. Okay. So no red flags. Now this is a very complicated thing to check to be honest. Right. There is no like right or wrong way of checking what is the meaning of like red flags for us. Okay. Now red flags can be 100. Okay. So for example, this is a Gen Sol engineering case. Now if you find a very specific company specific problem, right. I had Rajesh exports on my portfolio. I had to sell it because you know, corporate issues. Okay. And these out of like, you know, 3040 stocks that you have in your portfolio, at least two, three of them will have some kind of red flags. So whenever you start seeing red flags, just get out. Okay. So there is just no point in, you know, keeping these type of non-sense stocks. Cut to your 30, 40% loss, whatever it is. And it's okay to book losses. Okay. Your overall portfolio should win. It's not as if that you need to make money from every single individual stock. There is no end to this and there is no way to predict this. For example, no management will come on TV and say that, you know, what we are thieves. Please invest with us. No one is going to say that, right? And you can read like 20 annual reports. What will they write on annual reports? They say good good stuff. Only that are, you know, our CEO saves puppies and you know, he like, you know, helps like homeless people and you know, all good good things only they are going to save. Okay. They're not only say that, you know, what we are siphoning off money. Okay. One red flag that I have particularly seen is that you will see like founders that are doing a lot of PR. Okay. That's not really a healthy sign for a company. Right. The founders should focus on running their company, not doing like non-sense PR. That's a sign. It's not a given thing. Okay. So, but yeah, I mean, this is a qualitative factor. You can't do much and you can't investigate. You can read as many reports as you want. Okay. Okay. This is an important point. If the company has potential to go through PE expansion and if the company is undergoing an EPS expansion, now that's a very powerful quantitative indicator that the stock will grow. Okay. So, let me check. Right. I mean, if we can like pick an example of let's say, no, I'm like that. Okay. So, the PE of our stock is 24. Okay. So, here is and no, I'm like, I'm already like, whatever, six, seventy, eighty percent profits. I'd already bought this earlier. And this is a new company, right. I'm in first and foremost. This is a part of Edelweiss Group. Okay. So, this is in a broken business, broken trading securities. And what is the central theme of this? Right. So, this is in wealth management. Okay. So, first, understand, like nature of the business. So, this is wealth management. What do they deal with? Right. They deal with people invest money. Okay. Now, if people in India are getting richer, right. Something like Noama wealth will make lot more money. If more people get into equities stock markets, the Noama wealth is going to go up. Okay. So, the size of the investment community in India is the underpinning of this stock. That if the size of the Indian investing community goes gross from let's say 10 units to 50 units over the next 10, 15, 20 years, then this will also go like four, five X times. Okay. So, this is a very basic point. If the size of the investment community shrinks, then something like Noama wealth will suffer. Okay. So, this is the first underpinning that you need to understand about Noama wealth. Okay. Now, here, if the size of the industry, now this was this side explained earlier that there are three types of P's. One is called as industry P. One is called as PRPE. Okay. And one is called as absolute P. Okay. Now, Noama is or was a small cap company when I actually picked it. Now it has become a midi cap. Okay. So, you will see right here, there is no cost P history money because this is newly listed. Okay. So, it's not like, you know, you cannot do much. Right. But if you go and let's check, um, so, motto. Okay. So, let's say, so, motto. Right. So, so, motto, you will see 294 P. You'll go mad. Okay. So, this is like very happy. Right. Now, this is not here. The earnings are negative. So, again, this does not have a history. So, studying P.E. History of these type of companies does not lead to anything. Okay. Now, what do you think is going to happen in like, now, what is the underpinning for tomato? Like, what is, what does this P depends on? Okay. So, this P depends on earnings growth. If the company is able to grow its earning really fast and if the price grows by let's say 10 units, what the earnings grow by 100 units, the P will come down dramatically by a factor of 10. Everyone understands. Okay. That if the price of the stock is not growing, it's going sideways, but the earnings are expanding really fast for a high P company. Then the P will rationalize. Right. We are more worried about the future. Therefore, as a company, what is it that you need to check? You need to take a look at EPS growth. Okay. So, add one point in time in 2018. It's EPS or earning per share. Okay. Net profit will be the except for, but look at EPS. Okay. So, earning per share was minus 3000. Now, it has gone like this, this, this, this, this and 0.75. The moment this doubles to like 1.5, what will be the P assuming stock price is 202? The P will get cut in half. Why? Because P e may the price was same, 202. Okay. Ararning doubled, earning per share. So, this 294 becomes what? Right. Almost 150. Okay. Now, if it grows, EPS grows to 4 rupees. Okay. Then this keeps on going down. Okay. So, the hope with Zomato stock is this. So, if you are an investor in Zomato stock, what is it that you need to take a look? Now, P e lens, growth rate of the company, right? Or EPS growth rate. Now, if it suddenly becomes negative or if it has like two, three quarters of negative growth rate, uh, if it has two, three, uh, uh, two, three quarters of negative growth rate, then it's a slight problem. Okay. Everyone with me. Okay. Now, that's a very interesting question. Even I've been thinking that are people in India getting rich? The short answer is yes. Okay. Indians are getting rich. People in India might not be getting rich. Okay. That's a separate argument told together. Now, I'll say, how does that help me? It helps you a lot. Right. For example, I, up until now, I was giving like government, I don't know, five, six crore tax easily. You're, okay. Now, how much am I doing now? Answer is zero. Okay. Now, what am I doing with that money? I'll invest a large chunk of it back in India. Okay. So, and I'm in and I'm now almost 50, 60% of population in UA are Indians who make m
