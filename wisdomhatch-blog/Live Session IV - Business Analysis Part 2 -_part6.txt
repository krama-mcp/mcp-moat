==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text is a fragmented conversation touching on investment strategies, particularly in stocks, real estate, and bonds. Key themes include:  
- **Stock Investing**: Emphasis on holding fundamentally strong stocks long-term, avoiding illiquid stocks, and using technical analysis for swing trades.  
- **Real Estate**: Recommendations to invest in markets like Goa (for retirement lifestyles) and Dubai (for affordable options like Dubai Silicon Oasis), with advice against early purchases in crowded cities.  
- **Bonds**: Corporate bonds are endorsed for cash flow needs but deemed inferior to equity for growth; hybrid funds are discouraged.  
- **Process**: Stress on research (e.g., infrastructure soundness in Goa), portfolio size, and patience ("no rush" to invest).  

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Equity Strategy**: Hold stocks with a strong investment thesis; use technical levels (support/resistance) for swing trades. Avoid illiquid stocks.  
- **Real Estate Picks**:  
  - *Goa*: Ideal for retirement due to infrastructure and lifestyle appeal. Prefer ready properties (flats/villas) over land for outsiders.  
  - *Dubai*: Consider value areas like Dubai Silicon Oasis (min. ~1.5M AED for studios).  
- **Bonds**: Suitable for cash flow but lack capital appreciation; corporate bonds (purchased at discounts) are viable if real estate is unaffordable.  
- **General Advice**:  
  - No urgency to invest—wait for opportunities ("buy later").  
  - Research location-specific factors (e.g., infrastructure, demand shifts like Delhiites moving to Goa).  
  - Avoid commercial real estate in weak legal environments due to tenant risks.  
- **Screening Tools**: Rejects automated screeners; advocates curating a watchlist of 50–60 stocks and acting on research shared via communities.  
- **Regulatory Caution**: Avoids specific stock/bond recommendations due to complex compliance rules.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ve some talks that are like 14, 15, percent down like Irman, PBR, Dreamhooks, Indie, O issue. So if I sell them, right, on 27th March is the last financial year, last largest. So according to should I buy again or should I have sit with the gas? No, no, you buy again. Not a problem. Like these are good. Well, we are sitting. There is investment thesis. No. So that I'm investment thesis does not change you keep on holding it. Okay. And secondly, I have started, right. I've started like two years back. So my ticket size is not that that I can buy real estate. Yes. So what minimum you suggest that this should be the portfolio site then go for that because land I get like 56, she's like this is nothing. I live in the right. I live wrong. Number one, don't buy in early. Okay. So that's point one. Right. So look at some other place. Right. So otherwise, like, I mean, if you say that he I live in Singapore, I want to buy like a apartment, then you know, it costs a million dollar to buy a apartment. So there's nothing in that range. So that's the issue with cities, right. I would encourage you to learn like a little bit more about like Dubai and Goa. These are very good real estate markets. Because Goa is infrastructureally sound, right. I mean, the pressure on infrastructure is not that high and eventually like a lot of homeowners will buy here and people are moving more towards retirement lifestyle right with time because of the excessive pressure and the corporate life. So everyone would want to live in a creative environment when they're older, right. For example, half of the people that live in my society now are from Delhi. So like, we have fed up of pollution or whatever, right. So own in a place where infrastructure is sound and in India, there are very few such cities. I know only about Goa. So I can just comment on that rest. There might be many. So you have to investigate like these areas. So yeah, you want to buy it in a city. Like, and if you're considering, you know what boss I like like city life, that is much better. Dubai also minimum ticket should be one minute. Right. So now my portfolio is so much easier. So what should be? Buy later. So I mean, there's no rush. Right. So I mean, there's no race going on you buy later. Not an issue. And honestly, like you can buy it at like maybe 1.51.6 also. For example, one bedroom studio you will get. For example, there is an area called Dubai Silicon Wases. Right. So it's provides like value housing. So you can consider that. Right. So that area is decent. Right. For to buy at a decent ticket size. So that's what I want. And what range you suggest to enter goa like land. Land. Land. Don't buy like buy like ready property. If you, especially if you're an outsider and if you're not going to live in goa for the next 10, 20 years. Right. So you buy like a ready property. And that's cool. It's a not an issue. So buy anything in a society of flat or a villa, whatever you can get. It's fine. It's not like hyper over place. Right. I mean, as long as you're buying like good properties. Right. Okay. Thank you. Yeah. All right. Yeah. Uh, shikha. Concentrate. How do you separate stocks where you are doing a swing trade versus you might be wanting to hold it for 510 as in a real long term portfolio? There's more such thing as real long term. Right. So you just do whatever like the charts are telling you to do. So you just study a stock. If you have too much holding of it, for example, you buy nifty 50 because it is at an investible range. If it hits the resistance point, then you are not comfortable then you sell some. Right. So that's what I would say. Okay. Our next is fundamentally good shocks which do not form a part of the indices, but I have no volumes. How do you deal with them or you just leave them? I don't deal with them. Okay. So I have no interest in buying like a liquid things. Okay. So there's no way of anticipating that this stock may get greater volumes. No. There's no way. How can you say that? My last question is, uh, any screeners that you can share that we can use to filter down stocks for swing trades or old real long term? I'll tell you how to put screeners to buy like fundamentally good companies, right? But it's not an automated system. Stock miners cannot be automated. Right? At retail level, you have to just have a handful of like 50, 60 companies on your watch list and from that you keep on picking whenever price grows up, you keep on selling and that exercise does not require a crazy amount of time, right? Because I'm doing a lot of research for you guys. I like anyway, posting it on like WhatsApp groups and all that. So then, you know, your job is to just act on it right? I mean, by having conviction in your analysis. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So Akshad, I think in your back, we had started building a portfolio on our community, which is basically, uh, which was to contain about 50 or small cap stocks, which have a probability of becoming multi-baggers. And I think we could not take that conversation ahead. So any word on that or regulations don't allow it. Yeah. Already answered yourself. Okay. Sure. But then will you be able to help us give some tips on those because, uh, see, I mean, I can talk from an education point of view, but the moment I start telling people that you know what, this will make like this percent return or that percent return to start revealing my portfolio, all that. So like, I mean, the rules have been made very complicated now. Right? So even I don't know what is allowed. What is not allowed. It's just really complicated. Right? So that's what I can simply say. So even I'm not taking unnecessary chances. Right? Sure. Thanks. Paul, Akshad. Hi, Akshad. Good evening. My question is regarding the bond investing enough. Our channel earlier used to encourage us in terms of education point of view to search for the bonds in the golden pipe platform. Right? So, uh, that time also, the taxation was same as of today. Today also, the taxation is same. Nothing remains changed. And today, you have a viewpoint that don't invest. It means you are saying that we can't go for this bond investing. Uh, only investment is available is equity like that you are saying. So my question is that the taxation was same as of before or so same. Now, it's also same. That is a one question. Second question is that, uh, what in golden pipe platform I observed is that we can buy the bonds at discount. So, therefore, for example, if a bond is having a price value of one lakh, that bond I can get it in 90,000 also, 90,000 also. So, my, uh, what I'm getting the returns is much, not much very much, a little bit higher. So, comparatively, I'm getting a more interest rate than Ft. So, I can prefer a corporate bonds by learning as a seniority, secure bonds and all. And what is it? You want this? No, sir. I'm not discouraging bond investing. Someone asked me a question of, um, what do you call, um, hybrid funds, right? Which consists of equity plus bonds. Okay. So there I was saying that it's better to buy equity compared to bonds. If you want to buy bonds for cash flow, that's okay. There is no other option, right? Because many of us might not be able to afford real estate. And if you want regular cash flow, what is your option? Bonds, that's it. There is no other option and corporate bonds are very good. So, you buy corporate bonds, right? If you want cash flows because it solves your cash flow problem with certainty, right? So, you cannot compare it with the real estate, right? Because because the real estate will have the capital appreciation bond one. What problem is that real estate also have ticket size? So, for example, if you can't buy a real estate, if you don't have one credit crore to invest or 75 lakhs to invest, how like, then how do you buy real estate? So, then you have to go to the bond market for cash flow. I support cash flow. Okay, thank you. Got it. Okay, okay. Akshay, there we are. Yeah, hi, Akshay. So, should we use suggested of capital rotation, like if we're a nifty 50, channel is formed, we sell 50% of a nifty 50 stock, book some profit. And if it breaks out on higher side, yes. So, like, when what is, will be our executive strategy, if it breaks out on higher side? And break out. So, then a new channel is formed, right? So, for example, the support becomes like a new trade. You have already booked some profit. So, which means that you have additional 50 rupees to play around off of the units of capital to play around with in that channel. So, then you wait for a new support point to get formed. And then you take those trades. I see. Okay, one more thing I could not find out what's a link. I'll just drop us. Drop us a note. We'll figure it out. So, just try to us on our email ID. We'll add you to the group. Okay, it should be there. Right, I mean, from the email that you have purchased the course, the emails go out to that email ID. I see. I will check it out. Right. They're there in Koma. Hi, Akshay. So, I could not attend. I think you had one of your meetups in Bangalore for Bangalore real estate, but I could not attend that at that point. So, I wanted to understand about, since you previously talked about commercial real estate and commercial property, buying commercial properties that won't look good for buying commercial property. I have recently started thinking about commercial properties. And I don't know the process of how to go about it. I might have to look more about it. So, how do you suggest me to start that journey? Yeah, honestly, I don't know about commercial properties. I don't dabble into that. The reason is very simple. That commercial properties are rented to a business. And business people can create a lot of havoc in countries where the laws are weak. Right? For example, if someone's livelihood is dependent, let's say that you buy a show and you give it to like, and you give it on rent to like, let's
