==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses global economic trends, focusing on China's growth and its impact on world trade, the effects of U.S. trade policies under Trump, and the role of central banks in managing liquidity through quantitative easing (QE) and tightening (QT). It highlights how China and Germany are increasing liquidity and borrowing to stimulate their economies, emphasizing the importance of investing in markets to combat inflation. The speaker also touches on the probabilistic nature of market performance (60% up, 30% sideways, 10% down) and advocates for systematic investment plans (SIPs) as a strategy for average returns.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **China's Economic Influence:** China's growth (5–7%) is driving global trade, benefiting other nations through increased business opportunities.  
- **Trade Wars and Tariffs:** Trump’s trade war policies have already imposed significant tariffs, leaving little room for further escalation.  
- **Central Bank Policies:** Governments use QE (injecting liquidity) to stimulate economies, often leading to inflation, while QT (withdrawing liquidity) occurs during stable times.  
- **Market Trends:** Historically, markets rise 60% of the time, remain sideways 30%, and decline 10%, making long-term investing (e.g., SIPs) effective for average returns.  
- **Global Liquidity Shifts:** China and Germany are expanding liquidity (e.g., bond rate spikes) to address structural needs (e.g., energy independence, manufacturing competition).  
- **Inflation and Investment:** Inflation harms those holding cash; staying invested (70–80% in markets) hedges against devaluation.  
- **Asymmetric Bets:** Exposure to regions like Europe (e.g., Germany) may offer asymmetric opportunities due to economic restructuring, though outcomes are uncertain.  
- **Practical Advice:** SIPs work because markets trend upward over time, but returns typically match inflation-adjusted averages.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ver resolution it is China is opening up its world trade it's growing at 5 6% 7% right and as a result of China other nations are also growing because they are getting also more business from China okay Trump had done everything possible on you know trade war right I mean it has already he's already put tariff what new tariff will he put right so it's not like you know he'll go in and next countries that there is a certainty there when these four or five things happen no like then the Fed will stop expanding its balance sheet because people are anyways bullish during those times because there is a lot of certainty so you're happy putting your money or you're going to solve all of your market right so you'll put any way money right you're anyways building more businesses businesses are anyways expanding their capacity so this QT by the government is theoretically done when the times are already good and as a result of the stock market keeps on going up sharing some statistics markets typically go up 60% of the time 60 market goes sideways almost like 30% of the times right market goes down 10% of the times so if you don't understand anything and why SIPing typically works is because of the fact that the market keeps on going up okay so that is the reason why SIP works okay but because market is going up a lot of but in SIP you'll not make like more than average return you'll make inflation adjusted returns most of the time every ununderstands this entire view point on QE QT liquidity etc couple of quick updates here right so for example if you study what China is doing right so if you just simply go and google China liquidity increase okay so if you search this okay the people's Bank of China and this is 15th Jan news the people's Bank of China on Wednesday pumped 959 130 billion dollars worth of liquidity via 7-day reverse repurchase agreement they are increasing liquidity okay if you look at you're up long term borrowing okay so here you will see news let's have some news German Trappellary rating good borrowing rate now and I see another example has an hour this one'm any long term bond okay irification bond hertz Okay, so this should hopefully have the latest data. Okay, so do you see this spike right? I mean this I don't have like a paid plan, but you'll see this spike, okay, which is bond rates in Germany. So what Germany is doing is that it is it has increases for example, instead of paying. 3% as interest rates on its bonds, bonds means that I will give, you know, $100 to the German government or whatever their currency is. And Germany will pay me at the end of the day, $103. Okay, so that's Germany current interest rate. Now suddenly you saw spike in this one on a 10 year bond. Okay, now what is the meaning of this? This means that Germany wants a German government is collecting more money now. So that it can spend it in the economy and will pay the interest later. Okay, there's called an expansion of balance sheet. So even Germany right now is kind of increasing their balance sheet. Okay, for whatever spending it doesn't matter. Right. So for defense, energy, they might be building their own energy needs and all that. Right. So because Germany was being fueled by energy from Russia. Now that supply is cut off. So of course Germany has to build those basic structure systems. Germany's economy was contingent or a large part of it was contingent on high and automobile manufacturing China will eat into that in the next five to 10 years. Right. So it will be very bad times if they don't, if the European government does not start expanding its balance sheet. So does it kind of make sense to like take a little bit of exposure to Europe? Yes, it's called asymmetric bit. Now I cannot say that whether this will definitely play out or not, but it is an asymmetric bit. It could be considered. Okay, so I'm studying more. I'll let you know, you know, how to expand that. But I hope you got the perspective of what is the meaning of like liquidity quantitative easing quantitative tightening. Why does the government does QE? Why does the government does QT? If the government does QE quantitative easing it leads to inflation. Why inflation is bad? Why inflation is worse for people who are not investing because if you're if QE happens and you are investing in the stock market because of asset price appreciation. You will still make money, right. But if you're just keeping your money in cash in India, right, and not doing anything with it, then it brings to that grandfather's story that I was telling you in the morning that then that leads to a lot of trouble for you. Okay. So therefore net net. It's always good to be 70 80% invested in the market. Okay. So that's the idea. Right. And that's the spirit with which you should generally operate. Okay. Now what we're going to do is that we are going to take a five minute break. So we'll be back at 646 right and then we'll stop. Okay. And I'll take the question towards the end. Okay.
