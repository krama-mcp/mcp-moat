SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses investment strategies during a market correction, emphasizing the importance of cash flow positioning, portfolio diversification, and value investing. The speaker advises being fully invested if one has consistent new income (e.g., salary, rental income, or business profits) to capitalize on market dips. However, retirees or those without steady cash flow should avoid full market exposure. Key themes include assessing market valuation (e.g., comparing 3-, 5-, and 10-year returns), focusing on undervalued sectors (like Indian private banks), and simplifying investments (e.g., sticking to indexes like Nifty 50 or S&P 500). The speaker critiques over-analysis, advocating for broad judgment over mathematical precision in investing.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
1. **Cash Flow Determines Investment Aggressiveness**:  
   - If you have stable income (job, business, rental property), you can afford to be fully invested and buy dips.  
   - Retirees or those without new cash flow should limit market exposure (e.g., 75%).  

2. **Market Valuation Matters**:  
   - Compare returns over 3-, 5-, and 10-year periods. If the market delivers <12.5% CAGR, it may be undervalued.  
   - Example: Indian private banks are currently undervalued compared to the Nifty.  

3. **Simplicity in Investing**:  
   - Stick to broad indexes (e.g., Nifty 50, S&P 500) if you lack expertise in stock picking.  
   - A focused portfolio of 3–6 assets (e.g., stocks, gold, real estate) is sufficient.  

4. **Sector Opportunities**:  
   - Financial sectors (banks, insurance) may outperform due to India’s economic growth (~6.5% baseline + 2–3% alpha for quality companies).  

5. **Avoid Overanalysis**:  
   - Investing requires judgment, not extreme detail (e.g., reading 10 years of reports).  
   - Analogies: Business owners and long-term decisions (like marriage) rely on intuition, not exhaustive data.  

6. **Hedging Strategies**:  
   - For leveraged investors, covered calls can mitigate risk.  
   - Cash buyers should prioritize liquidity to exploit market corrections.  

7. **Philosophy**:  
   - "Do less, do it well" — focus on high-conviction opportunities rather than diversifying excessively.  
   - Market timing is secondary to cash flow management and valuation awareness.  

*Note: The text is informal and repetitive, but the core ideas revolve around pragmatic investing, risk mitigation, and aligning strategy with personal financial circumstances.*

ORIGINAL TEXT:
do if the market corrects by 20%? Now, this depends on your cash flow positions. Okay? Cash flow position means that market is going to be a market correct. Another 20% and we are here. Right? So in 2026 for example, here we are right in one year. The market corrects by another 20%. My 10CR becomes 8CR. But this is not the bad news. Right? Here, what has happened is that the for me to have 20% correction on this 10CR portfolio. What needs to happen? The nifty needs to fall to 18,500. Okay? Which means what? That one day when nifty goes from 18,500 to 26,000. Right? How much money will I make? A lot of money because you are getting right? That how this will be like a higher number. Right? So as long as I'm making new money, right? Over the next one to two years. It's a man. I'm fully invested. But I will be making more money in 2025. Right? 2026. Now, can I do I have a 20% hedge? For example, can I invest new to CR into the market over these two years in case the opportunity comes? Okay? That is the meaning of handling or like having the ability to handle a fall. Okay? If I'm leveraged, then I will do, then I will sell covered calls or something. Okay? So that's a separate strategy altogether. Right? But as a cash buyer, we need to always be cognizant. Of our cash flow assets. Right? So again, taking you back to this and how it relates beautifully to everything. See, having this bucket, bucket solid cash flow bucket. This is absolutely critical. Okay? So this is a very important bucket. For example, real estate. If you have, and if you have cash flow real estate every month, you are getting some money for sure. Right? Guaranteed. Or if you have a very stable job, that's again a cash flow asset. If you have a small business, that's a cash flow asset. If you have something else, right? I mean, let's say, wife is also earning, right? Our husband is also earning, right? Two partners, all that stuff. Right? So all that are like, if you are getting like after retirement benefits and all that, right? So in those are cash flows. Okay? So these cash flow positioning becomes really important. People who do not have new money coming in, they should never be fully invested in the market. Okay? Unless you are getting it at deeply undervalued zone. Now, what is the meaning of deeply undervalued zone? For example, compare the market on a three-year basis, compare the market on a five-year basis, compare the market on a ten-year basis. If on all of these three basis, if the market is giving you less than 12.5% EHR, we could say that it is undervalued. Add like a 15% margin on it. Okay? So for example, I've even had a competition with Ithon five-year basis that we are at 13, 14% EHR, we are fairly valued. Okay? I can afford to be fully invested. Why? Because my cash flow positions are such that I will be getting with a high degree of certainty another two-seer in the next two years. More than on the market, right? So if it falls, I'll invest another two. Okay? But if the situation is such that I'm retired, I don't have any other source of income. I don't have any real estate. I don't have a job. My only thing is stock market. That's my entire portfolio. How much should you be investing right now in the Indian market? I would say around 75%. Okay? So I hope you got the perspective that the answer of investing might be different for me and it might be different for you. Okay? But two things matter. Two three things. Number one is your point of entry, which is absolutely critical. Okay? Number two. Are you buying a market which is somewhat like to what extent will you invest? And this intern depends on your cash flow positions. Okay? Any questions guys on this so far? No. Okay? Awesome. Either I'm teaching really well or I'm teaching really bad. So like, when do I sell? So that's a separate class altogether guys. So don't worry about selling, right? Because this is the buying market now, right? So you have to understand it. Everyone understood why am I not buying like US stocks, like 100% why I'm not there. Right? So when I'm like maybe 25, 30% yet. Okay? How to draw these support lines also I will teach in very teach technical analysis. So I will do that. Okay? How to choose stock? But I'm going to stock right? So just simply buy index if you don't understand much. Okay? So you don't even need to buy an individual stock. Okay? So like, I mean, honestly, if you can just literally trade or invest sensibly in index, that's good enough money. Okay? You don't even need to pick any other asset. You literally pick like three, four assets. That's it. Okay? So you know how to like for example, people imagine that you know what, if you give me like a like a knife or machete and you know, summarize what I can, you know, sort of crush like Bruce Lee. Right? No, well, lots of more they're not. Even if someone gives you a knife, you can't do anything. It's about using your weapons. Well, okay? So that's more important. Right? So all these are different weapons. It has got nothing to do with like in how many access assets you have access to. Okay? More about for example, if you are choosing literally, Nasdaq, S&P 500, Nifty 50, BTC, Gold real estate. If these are like six, seven assets, that's it. You don't even need to go to a GFC bank. Okay? Then comes natural question. Why are you going to a GFC bank and all right? See, over time, what I've started to do is and I've started to appreciate the beauty of doing less. Okay? So in the sense that the less you do, the better it is. Right? I'm also understanding more of it. Everyone needs to go through a journey. And sometimes, you get opportunities. Right? For example, there is very good opportunity in private bank index. Okay? So it's good banks are undervalued. Even more than Nifty. So let me show that also. Okay? So for example, private bank. Why is this not working? Okay. Let's just say good. I have it. I think. Lifty. So. Yeah. So here, if you take a look, right? So again, let's do the same analysis. Okay? So for example, if you look at the last five years of private bank. Okay? So for example, here, if you do, this is 52. Now, if you divide it by five, now this is like eight, nine percent nine percent C. Okay? Now, this is way undervalued compared to even Nifty. Okay? So therefore, like I will give you a portfolio. I will show you. Right? So I literally have like banks insurance company, few hospitals. Nifty and private bank. That's it. That's all I have. 70 percent 80 percent of my stocks are right now in his. Is in finance. Okay? So that's that's where I am. Right? So I literally have like Nifty 50 and. So I have like a few financial stocks. That's it. There's nothing much else going on. Okay? I know I vote for you. So it's a very simple portfolio right now. Will it forever remain simple? No, it will get complicated depending on the market. Okay? So right now, I'm just trying to buy value. That's it. Okay? I hope you guys get it. Right? Now, how do you roughly estimate this? Okay? Again, let's do the same analysis. At what rate does India's economy grow? Six, six and a half. That's a baseline rate. Right? Six and a half one. Right? Now, if you add like good quality companies, top 50, 2% alpha, 3% alpha, 1 low, banks, financials will go faster. So 11% 12% CGR gas plus 1 low, right? So based on that, banks are undervalued. Okay? So definitely undervalued. Right? So that's how we will roughly get there. Now, you'll say, can you prove it mathematically? Bhai is science. Okay? So I'm not like a physicist. Okay? Investing is broad, broad math. Investing is not like, you know, I've proved everything. You know, prove. You're on the Excel. You know, Excel people do not make any money in the stock market. Otherwise, it's only PhD guys who would be investing in the stock market. Okay? Stock market. You know, you need to have like a heart in terms of investing. Another risk mitigation strategy. People who are good at business are very good at stock markets naturally. Right? So for example, because they understand how to mitigate risk. Running a business is not about, you know, doing like exceptional things. It's mostly about risk mitigation. Right? That you understand where there is cleaning and nailing. It's judgment. Right? So judgment is the most important skill in the world. Right? And honestly, like you can't eat a ball. For example, people look at like, you know, PV ratio, Nimb ratio, you know, it's going to be a merger. It will be a year. Bhai, ek bha, bha, right? Simplesy. Right? You ask your mom and dad and dadu, right? Then how, what's the most important decision they took in life? They'll say that marrying was the most important decision they took. Okay? And as I'm how much time did it take you to marry like mom or marry dadi? They'll say, I was there, right? Right? They're happy. Right? And shadi, right? So, usmeda am nindma sotshani, right? And buying like one private bank, if tea, you are like, you know, analyzing like 500 reports. It's stupidity, right? Some idiots say that, you know, okay, you have to read like last 10 year reports of a company. What will you find in that? Nothing. Okay? So that's the bottom line. Right? So that's what you need to think. Okay? And when it comes to buying like one stock or one something like this, motor motor analysis, only you can do. Okay? So, you cannot do. Okay? So that's hopefully it kind of gives you sense. Okay? So already. Okay? Nifty for an individual large cap stocks for more than then how come nifty 50 is attractive now individual large caps. So that has to do with something called as business analysis. Okay? So for example, if you're buying a manufacturing company. Or manufacturing large cap for example page industries. Now, I'm just using it as an example. I have not revisited the stock. Now, what is the manufacturing growth rate in India? 2.5. Okay? Right now. So structure, really it's worse for manufacturers. Now, why would you go and pick
