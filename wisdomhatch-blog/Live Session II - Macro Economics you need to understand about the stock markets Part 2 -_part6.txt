==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text appears to be a transcript of an investment-focused class or discussion, covering a broad range of topics including stock market strategies, asset allocation, technical analysis, and specific investment recommendations. The speaker emphasizes the importance of understanding macroeconomics, entry/exit points, and long-term investing. They discuss volatility management (e.g., spreading investments in BTC), caution against overvalued assets (e.g., gold), and advocate for fundamental and technical analysis. Specific mentions include bullish views on semiconductors, private bank ETFs, and startups like Swiggy/Zomato, while avoiding certain US stocks (e.g., Netflix, Apple). The speaker also hints at future lessons on tools (e.g., TradingView), market cycles, and international investing.  

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Volatility Management**: For volatile assets like BTC, consider spreading investments (e.g., 6–7 installments/year) to average out risk.  
- **Exit Strategies**: Prioritize learning technical analysis for determining entry/exit points, even for long-term investors.  
- **Overvalued Assets**: Avoid assets like gold when sentiment is overly bullish, as asymmetric returns are unlikely.  
- **Sector Preferences**: Bullish on semiconductors, private banks, and high-growth startups (e.g., Swiggy, Zomato); cautious on overvalued US tech (e.g., Netflix).  
- **Diversification**: Advocate for keeping 30–40% cash in overexposed portfolios (e.g., NASDAQ) to weather corrections.  
- **Fundamental vs. Technical Analysis**: Both are essential—fundamentals for stock analysis, technicals for timing trades.  
- **Long-Term Focus**: Emphasize baseline benchmarks (e.g., 20-year returns) and macro trends (liquidity/inflation) over short-term noise.  
- **Tools/Resources**: Recommends platforms like TradingView, Screener.in, Zacks.com, and BY Charts for research.  
- **Rebuilding Portfolios**: If down significantly (e.g., 45%), consider restarting with a structured approach rather than holding losing positions.  
- **Geographic Focus**: The current course is India-specific, with future workshops planned for international markets (e.g., Dubai).  

*Note: The text is somewhat disjointed, likely due to being transcribed from spoken language, but the core themes revolve around disciplined investing, risk management, and continuous learning.*

ORIGINAL TEXT:
sting your money, right? I mean, if you have like 100 crores and if you invest it poorly, you can lose generational wealth in a matter of years. Is there a good exit point for booking guests? So I will tell you, talk, there is a specific class on exiting stocks, okay? Good entry point for something like BTC. BTC is a volatile asset. So instead of doing like four SIPs or like four bucks, try to do like six, seven bucks in a year, okay? So you invest less amount in it. So that will averages out volatility. Chinnai better, I have no idea. Okay? So he shared few index to invest both in India and yours, okay? I encourage one of you and I said, yeah, that's a good time to buy. You don't ask me like individual stocks, okay? So the objective of this class is to help you analyze stocks. You yourself will be able to do it. So please go through the course, okay? Where are we in the market? Okay. Yes, there will be a checklist. I'll share it, okay? We have a separate class at US. Would we be going into tools? I'm already explaining you tools, right? Right in front of you, right? So you should be able to see it, right? So for example, today we learned a little bit of public city. We learned a little bit of trading view. I'll teach tomorrow, okay? So we'll proceed from there. For US, are you investing in M7? No, like not all M7. Tesla, I don't buy Netflix. I want to buy, but it is pollution look a little bit expensive. Amazon, Microsoft are fine. I'm buying. What else? Apple, I'm not buying. Google, I'm not buying. Met I'm not buying as of now. Buy no discussion. We will discuss subsequently. Okay. Ah, thank you. So the market goes up in both, what are the point of these concepts? I just told you because you will go sideways. For example, market will go long term in QT also, right? But that does not mean that you go and buy small cap index now. By that logic, you should invest your money in the fastest growth possible asset. But now the problem is that the market goes sideways. Okay. So how do you deal with that? So therefore, you need to know that, right? Realize schemes are arbitrary review dream folks. I'll use all these examples. What do you have? You are a semiconductor. I'm bullish on semiconductor. It will, right? I mean, it's a fast growth industry. The company called doing the run regulated change. Okay. All right. If you already invested in overvalued stocks like NASDAQ, what should be the current strategy? NASDAQ is not a stock. It's an index. If you have already invested at high levels, then the idea is to at least have like 30% 40% cash age. Okay. So that in case there is a correction, you know that okay, you're prepared for a 20% fall. That's the idea. Okay. Swiggy is good. Swiggy, there is no problem. You also tell me like, I mean, you know, five really strong startups and in-lands, Swiggy will feature into that. That's a huge market. They are expanding everywhere like Zomatos. So Zomatos, Swiggy, both are very good companies, right? They have massive growth prospects. Screener, Guru focuses a good website. There is called as Zack's.com. There is another website. You can check that. There is something called as BY charts. You can check that. If you already have a house, then you don't need to buy another real estate. Unless you're portfolio grows to a particular scale. Okay. No, so I said that the chances of if the P of a stock is already good, then the chances of it expanding is higher. Okay. For example, Deemart is already at a high P. Now, if it is unable to maintain its growth rate, it will fall. The P will correct. And as a result, despite companies posting very good results, the stock will still fall. But on the flip side, go tech mind the Ravank, even if it grows at a 10-15% growth rate, which is very doable because its P is low. It's a good stock from an investing point of view. It is very important to technical analysis because markets have become very volatile. Okay. I was not a proponent of technical analysis. Now, I do not mean that up the screen, you know, I'll get better. Right? I mean, you're not becoming a date reader. But figuring out your point of entry and point of exit, even for investors is very important. Right? So you cannot discount technical analysis. I'll teach technical analysis more from a point of entry and point of exit. NVIDIA is very good. Okay. What is your view point on JP power? All run-up has happened. I've already made like very good money. So, okay. So like 250% run-up has happened. What if your portfolio is down? What should be the strategy? Please sell all your stocks, rebuild it from scratch. Okay. So if you're down 45%, it means that you know, no, no, any investing. Okay. So I'm being blunt with you. Okay. So like just learn, unlearn everything that you've learned about investing so far and just build it right from scratch. Okay. Entry point of gold bees. See, gold according to me has run-up. I will not touch it. As of now, it is already too bullish. Okay. So this is called a sentiment analysis. Sentiment on gold is at an all time high. And if sentiment is all time high on something, you can be rest assured. That you're not going to make asymmetric returns on a long-term basis. So always think long-term. So therefore, I'm not buying much gold. Okay. So yeah. Will you be covering the basis on especially if you are living in Dubai? Not on this course. This was an India specific course. I'm doing a Dubai workshop. Right. So I mean, in case you guys want to come to Dubai, they're I'll cover like international investing more. Okay. Okay. In the market downturn, what is better investing in index or in it doesn't matter. Wherever the operation it is. For example, just a private bank ETF may. Opportunities there. If you look at semiconductor index, opportunities there. If you look at even Bitcoin opportunities there, it is corrected by like 35% from the top. Right. So it really depends. I mean, for example, if the market is in a very clear trend up trend, for example, now then you have to become like even more stock specific. Right. Right. You can go like index. If I liquidate or a more courage, large cap, PMS, how would you advise to invest it? Okay. See, I mean, please wait for the classes to get over. You will have more clarity. Right. Today, we covered the macro, right, which is very important because macros move the needle. Right. I mean, for example, if you're not investing in a time when there is very clear chance of more liquidity into the market, that's bad. Okay. So you lose a lot of money or potential returns. Similarly, if you know that liquidity tightening will happen. And if you don't cut your positions, that's again, okay. So please wait. You'll have more idea. Okay. I'm a fan ETF. There are enemies. I had. No, no, no, no, no. I'm a fan ETF. So yes and no. Please wait. Okay. So you'll have more idea. How and where can I buy semiconductor index in India? You can use vested in case you guys haven't opened your account. Right. I'll ask my team to post it on the WhatsApp group that we have created. If you use that because I'm an angel investor invested, you'll get some discounts. Okay. So that I will talk because you guys are my students. So there will be special benefits. Okay. Can you put more light to what fundamental factors look for? Yeah. So fundamental analysis we have a separate last. Today was macro economics. Okay. How to get details of liquidity is going down or up inflation. So for example, if inflation is completely controlled, most likely they are going to push growth and if the growth is slowing down. So you just simply have to go through cycles. So tomorrow I'll explain this concept. Okay. Energy stocks are very good. I don't know about energy stocks in India. Even I am searching. I'm learning more about this industry. So I'll have more useful answer for you after a month. But how to find benchmark numbers for each asset class for deciding under value like when you are. So here, it's generally. Right. So if you look at the last 20 years, so we are using that as a baseline. So long term is a good baseline. Right. So typically speaking, the last 20 or mid cap returns would be around 20 for large and large cap it will be 12 to 13. I don't think gold will correct, but it will go in a time correction. So it is already at like highest ever sentiment. So to say, a one the feeds, but large oldings, project industries guys, I don't know what every stock. Like I cannot comment. Can any of us. I'm not right now guys. I mean, if you are in the right then only I can consult right. So technically, I cannot Indian residents. So that's an issue. Yeah. If I want to start investing in the US, yes, it's a good time. You can start because it's not as if that you know, when the nifty is sorry, Nasdaq is down like 30, 40 percent only then you will. It's a little bit of an investor to do. So that you have some skin in the game, right? You can at least track. It's okay to lose like 10, 15 percent of your portfolio temporarily because that way you will be in the game. Your view technical analysis, I'll teach you separately. So don't worry. Okay. Which private bank ETF any private bank ETF? It doesn't matter. The idea is to buy private bank. Short term trading. I don't know. So I don't teach. Okay. I teach swing trading. Regular to direct should means that the whole amount and check. Many so invest the whole amount. It's just cut it one from this and you're moving to this and right. Maybe there will be a three four day delay. Whatever happens that's separate on a large scale. It doesn't matter. Okay. Should we have one lack to be for trading and investing in what context? Right. So I mean, like you should invest whatever spare money. Which broker invest in US market from the buy. IBKR is good. Your banks are good. So if you're doing like bank based apps, those are fine. You use why why I was good. It's all these are good. What all business newspapers do you read nothing? Ok
