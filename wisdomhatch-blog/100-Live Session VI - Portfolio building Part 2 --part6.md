==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a dialogue about portfolio management, diversification, and investment strategies. It covers topics like balancing stock investments, maintaining cash positions, tax advantages in different markets, and decisions around small/mid-cap investments. The speaker emphasizes not over-concentrating in single stocks (max 5% per stock), tax-efficient investing (especially for UAE residents in US markets), and adapting strategies based on market valuations. The discussion also touches on Bitcoin ETFs and the importance of holding cash in overvalued markets.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Diversification**: Avoid concentrated portfolios; limit individual stock exposure to 5% to reduce risk.  
- **Tax Efficiency**: UAE tax residents benefit from zero taxes on US stock investments, making US markets more attractive than India for them.  
- **Cash Position**: Hold 20% cash in overvalued markets (e.g., when long-term CAGR exceeds 14%).  
- **Sector Rotation**: Rebalance over-invested stocks by redirecting funds to similar themes (e.g., selling HDFC to buy other bank stocks).  
- **Small/Mid-Caps**: Exit overvalued segments (e.g., the speaker exited small/mid-caps at peak valuations).  
- **Bitcoin Exposure**: Confusion exists around Bitcoin ETFs in India; clearer guidance is needed.  
- **Market Timing**: Invest new money into underweight assets to rebalance, rather than adding to existing overweight positions.  
- **Long-Term Focus**: Decisions should align with current market conditions, not past or hypothetical scenarios.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ike the the fundamentals remain the same okay yeah so the fundamentals remain the same what I have taught you right tomorrow I'll comment I'll do like to teach a little bit about wallet I need 2x5 x stocks unlisted stocks so say clear or jiv and small finance I'll use it as an example okay tomorrow okay okay so Ganya Kanchan I'm going to show you hey so my question is more than the portfolio investments split right like let's say currently I have a 20 lakh portfolio and I'm fully invested Indian market in that I have a 50% and index multiple indexes and other are in 5 to 6 stocks so which makes my stock investment of each stock more than 10 to 50% yes and how do I balance it and since I am fully invested now right and I have a capacity of investing let's say 50 to 60,000 every month going forward as well as a salary employee so how do I do that and how many stocks in total I can have it in a portfolio is there like something minimum stocks if your portfolio is more than 10 lakhs should be 20 okay so if you're buying individual stocks you should not have a concentrated portfolio right otherwise you start panicking right even good companies collapse many a times right so there's no point in for example I trust HDFC bank a lot right not because I'm like you know like I love being their customer I hate it right but I mean I know that they are crooks and they're going to make great money so like to me as an shareholder it kind of makes sense but bottom line being that even there my investment is not more than 5% of my portfolio okay very rarely I will hit like 5% on any stock so Google I feel comfortable I'll do that right but like I'm in majority others I will not right even HDFC I'll not so what I would simply say is that see if you're over invested in some stocks two things you can do one is that you immediately cut position and bring it into similar stocks for example let's say that you have 10% holding on HDFC then you sell half of your HDFC portfolio tomorrow or whenever market opens and you buy some access bank ICI CIA similar themed stocks tomorrow itself okay so that way there is no loss right because it's not as if that only HDFC will go up and access will not go up right or something of that sort okay that's one strategy second strategies that you say that okay not have bought these good stocks I don't want to rotate you don't invest your new money into your existing stocks you just buy like access ICI CIA and you stop investing in HDFC till the time your portfolio kind of starts making more sense right I mean you start seeing like everything equally spread okay and whenever we found that find the opportunity based stock also we should not go beyond these stock limit right 5% right that's a golden rule that's okay greedy okay so no one don't be greedy okay so number one rule go I think okay and last question in capital rotation let's say I'm rotating my capital on index right I am then should I mean is it advisable to have in reinvest in the same or like partially hold it to reinvest in the same like how do I say so you don't you don't need to keep on investing every month right so for example if this this month let's say index has hit the resistance so you sell 20% index you just do an FD for two three months if you get an opportunity to buy the same index after two three months you buy it okay okay all right answer okay so my first question is around the US portfolio so I started building the portfolio in US market through Wested around a couple of years back and I'm almost 75% invested if I consider the country wise diversification that I want to achieve now if I become the part of your community you are just 30% invested and I'm already 75% invested yes how would you recommend how can I map your recommendations to mine okay so to invest yes so see you are at a mature stage in US investing I'm at a nascent stage of my portfolio I'm not much sure I've done all through your advices only so whatever I've built so far so see I'll reveal the reason also right and I hope you guys will understand it as well right see at this like up until last year I was an Indian tax resident so moving money from India to the US was a major pain point right that's one second is that I was still being taxed really high now the reason why I need to invest a lot more in the US market is very simple that access for me is zero right for example if I invest money in Indian stocks short term is 20% for me 12.5% is LTCG if I invest in US stocks short term is zero long term is zero so because of this arbitrage right I'm already like in top 1% investors in the US okay now even like Warren Buffett has to pay taxes in the US because he's not a tax resident of the way okay but if you're an Indian tax resident or sorry if you're a way tax resident investing in the US market taxes was you is zero so can I beat Warren Buffett yes I should I have to be really dumb not to right I mean with this massive tax advantage going my way and small portfolio to manage I have to it's not as if that I'm a genius it is as I'm structured really well right so therefore I'm moving bulk money in the US right it's not as if that when I was giving that advice right off investing like 15 20% for you guys in the US I still stand by it right Indian should have 20 30% exposure to the US stocks now given the things there but if you're a UAE tax resident should you have like maybe 80% exposure to the US over India yes right because of tax that arbitrage more than anything else okay so that was that now more but more importantly I mean how you can copy my trades all that see I don't know your age and I should not ask like emails their age right and that's what the losses are so around 45 so I'm okay do really that so so bottom line being that you know now you would invest for like another 15 20 years so anyway that will like you know sort of balance out it's not a problem on a long term basis second key point is that you can consider adding whatever I'm adding right so for example if you like let's say I'm adding like Google today right hypothetically in certain quantity then you can replicate that right I mean just adjust it as per your portfolio that's two third and most importantly is that I have been quite vocal that US market is overvalued so you need to have like 20 percent cash positions okay so yeah so I mean if you're doing these three things I think your problem kind of gets sorted over time so I probably can map your trades to whatever remaining cash I have to invest in to exactly for example if you're already over invested in Google and don't buy Google right now okay sure my second question is rather I'll explain you this is a little bit of personalized situation which I would explain you and I already have taken that decision but I would just want to know from you whether I did the right thing or wrong thing okay so I invested into small and mid cap through PMS in September 2023 for one and a half years continuously I kept on booking profits so I booked profits of 33 percent over one and a half years now since market started correcting and since small and mid caps were overvalued I took out the entire amount in February 2025 when my portfolio had come down by 20 percent so net net in one half years I had the profit of 14 percent around so maybe a tag of 10 or 11 percent now whatever cash I have I'm planning to invest 50 percent of that into 50 50 and fly it by and 50 percent into China and US markets so does this make sense whatever I did or you would have tackled it differently I don't know like I mean that's obligate for me to like you know say whether that was right or wrong thing to do but I mean good thing is that you booked some real profits that was nice right especially at a time when small mid caps were overvalued then the hindsight it looks great and guys I even I was lucky right I mean I that I was able to exit small mid caps because it looked hyper overvalued I exit it literally exited everything okay so like 100 percent exit okay so which I rarely do right on anything right but I was lucky there right I mean it's also investing is also a factor of luck I cannot say whether that was right move or wrong move but all I can simply say is that hey today like this small cap undervalued no small cap a great asset okay it's like okay I said right I mean so I would not touch it right so I mean unless I'm seeing like a 20 percent upside on something like small and mid caps why would I touch it it doesn't make sense no so I will not do it today right so make decisions for today right I mean don't make decisions for like tomorrow or yesterday yes I am that's all I'll say okay sure and our last request is I have asked these questions earlier as well but for bitcoins please do write some information around ETF and those cash trust and all because all that is pretty confusing so bringing India how to really get an exposure to bitcoins is something which is which I have not been able to solve for past couple of years so I've been investing into bitcoins waste but then that also gives exposure to lots of stocks say Tesla right to strategy right so I just I'm not able to decide whether that's the right thing wrong thing okay okay let me write okay thanks hey actually hi good you need I'll have three questions and one quick request so I'll be like quick so you mentioned 20 percent cash position where you're expanding up trend downtrend and sideways movement right so what's the typical I mean when should we hold that 20 percent cash and when we like when should we go like fully and exhaust that 20 percent no so it has got nothing to do with up trend downtrend you hold 20 percent cash when on a five and 10-year basis the market looks overvalued just for example and as well average C.A.G.R should not be more than 14 percent but right now if you check the C.A.G.R it will be 18 19 percent so it is overvalued right therefore I'm saying so at most you should be 80
