==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses market trends (uptrend, downtrend, sideways) and sentiment analysis (bearish, bullish, neutral) in stock investing. The speaker emphasizes investing during downtrends or bearish sentiment to capitalize on undervalued opportunities, using examples like Google's recent price drop. Key advice includes diversification (limiting single-stock exposure), patience, and avoiding over-analysis. The goal is to buy quality assets at discounted prices during market panic, aligning with long-term wealth-building strategies.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Three Market Trends**: Uptrend (rising prices), downtrend (lower highs/lows), and sideways (range-bound).  
- **Sentiment-Based Investing**: Buy during bearish sentiment (panic/corrections), avoid overinvesting in bullish markets.  
- **Downtrend Opportunities**: Best time to invest, especially when stocks/indexes correct 20%+ (e.g., Google’s 25% drop).  
- **Diversification Rule**: Limit single-stock exposure to 5% of capital to manage risk.  
- **Patience & Long-Term Focus**: Investing is like "raising a child"—requires time and discipline.  
- **Avoid Overanalysis**: Broad analysis suffices; excessive scrutiny can hinder decision-making.  
- **Price-Sentiment Mismatch**: Real wealth is made by buying quality assets at discounted prices during panic.  
- **Index vs. Individual Stocks**: Wait for trend reversals in indexes, but individual stock downtrends can offer standalone opportunities.  
- **Example**: Google’s downtrend represents a buying opportunity due to bearish sentiment and uncertainty.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
-in but if you want to do all-in respecting this channel then this is fine somewhat okay this is a short term trend this is called as uptrend okay so I I'll just quickly talk about this in a minute so three types of trends that we have studied right so this is an uptrend right this is an uptrending market okay still ideally we should invest majority of our money in a downtrending market okay right now this is an uptrend everyone understands why this is an uptrend okay what is a downtrend this is a downtrend everyone can see why is this a downtrend okay what is a sideways trend this is a sideways trend okay it goes like this and from 15 to almost 17 18 this is a sideways trend okay this is an uptrend okay this is a side trend okay this is an uptrend okay so you'll have uptrends downtrend okay this is an uptrend right and similarly this might or might not be a downtrend a downtrend would be when it looks something like this yeah from here on a weekly calendar okay so it falls like this there is a channel breakdown right and it goes something like this okay so something like this could happen okay everyone understands I'll just draw this like a little bit more carefully right this important point to notice that's this is an uptrend everyone understand why this is an uptrend okay what will be a downtrend here that it goes something like this so this is a downtrend okay downtrend typically means that you will have higher lows okay so for example this low is this high is lower than the previous high okay this high is lower than the previous high this high is lower than the previous high everyone got it what is the meaning of downtrend for example here this is a high this is a high this is a high and this is a trend reversal in the middle but these three things are downtrend everyone with me okay now if you study this right from a sentiment so we are trying to do a sentiment analysis okay when do you think so our goal is to buy bearish sentiment okay three types of sentiments are there bearish bullish neutral okay we can add more stuff in bearish we can add more stuff in neutral we don't buy much in bullish okay it will look counter intuitive then okay why you not buying in bullish you sell in bullish okay you don't buy in bullish okay three types of trends bearish bullish and neutral now what type of trend is this this is a bullish trend okay why because this is an uptrend okay now is there panic right now no when will there be a panic okay when this corrects a lot okay when that trend reverses that is when panic is when we go in a down trend that's when panic will happen especially if the market corrects a lot from its top okay from here to here market is corrected by minus 10 percent okay but the trend is still bullish this might get a little bit complicated so please listen carefully okay the trend is bullish okay but what might happen is that it will touch like this it will go up okay it will touch like this it will go up okay and as long as this channel is this being respected this is still an uptrend you're getting it okay and this is where people get confused right that okay you're saying uptrend and you're saying down trend also then you know so we're not getting it what I'm trying simply trying to say is that if you study this channel okay this is an uptrending channel okay now it can go in two ways from here where we currently are we are here okay one has that it might it might behave like this this is still an uptrend okay or it goes like this right it falls and it goes into a down trend okay if we get to buy this and this is where panic will be and if this happens was then a Mandir Chattayana mid-hybridized right so whenever you see this because that is when you can go and buy another house okay so like I feel very happy when the session comes okay so like I'm jubiliant okay in your youtube you recently mentioned if Tlb sideways next couple of years how do you say that what do I know yes I'll speak about that also but I hope everyone understands what is the meaning of uptrend and down trend as long as we are in an uptrend there is no panic let people make noise okay people will truly panic when the market corrects by 20% from the top of 15% from the top and we are in a down trend okay that is when you should have money to invest in the stock markets if you don't have money to invest in the stock market you will not make much money okay and even if at that point in time you are just simply buying indexes it's fine not a big deal okay now this situation can happen at an individual stock level also or index also so let me explain it by using Google example okay so for example I'll for bet okay okay okay now what type of now this is panic okay what do you see this was an uptrend you can see okay and if this was respected this would have been in an uptrend okay but it broke okay and it has corrected by how much 25% from its top okay and maybe it's in a down trend now right that only time will tell us okay okay now what is happening here okay so what is happening here is that see this will become might it might become like this right then it might go sideways okay it might fall again I don't know but the point is that this is a great time to buy this stock okay why because you are buying a down trend when the stock has corrected by more than 20% a good company okay now therefore like learning individual stock investing is critical because many a times you don't get an opportunity to buy S&P 500 on as time but you get an opportunity to buy an excellent stock at very good valuations yes I'm buying Google yes okay so yeah okay now this is called as position building right this comes with experience and you'll say yeah it's not so much as I'm just there's a poor lane nothing can be done like it's like everyone can do do gardening no it's a very time consuming patient process it's like raising a child right so it requires massive patients okay so you're still in the arms you're going to be in the next six years right so I mean it's not so much patients it's right so it doesn't make sense okay then you'll wait for another fall after like two three years and all that whenever you are getting an opportunity buy it okay now you'll say that okay what's the guarantee that Google will come up therefore we have a rule of diversification that we will not invest more than five percent of our capital on any single stock now you'll say that that doesn't make us very comfortable you are a research analyst right you should you should learn like about every stock how would I know okay you're not sure which I does not know what he's going to do next okay so even he does not know how AI will evolve it's useless nonsense for me to go and analyze like their companies every move it doesn't add up okay broad broad it should add up okay so for example it's like this your mom and dad video career decision okay like all boys here Karadina engineering right so it's not as if key but a good decision we have to start right so then they knew you from Buchpan right so your parents have done like PhD on you and still they suggested you like engineering career path or whatever right so bottom line being that over analyzing it also does not really help okay you have to do like broad analysis only okay so broad analysis here tells us they're right now you're getting to buy Google at good sentiments okay why because they are in a bearish sentiment okay number two the trend has changed the trend has become a downtrend okay should you over invest in snp 500 no because we have to wait for a trend reversal on that okay now comes if we add both of these things okay for example this is Google right it has fallen by 25 percent I'd shown you snp 500 that snp 500 was going something like this it was somewhere here okay now imagine this that if snp 500 also breaks this line and falls below this trend and the trend reversal happens trend the reversal happens here also here trend reversal has already happened yeah on Google what do you think is going to happen on Google it will fall more why because if the entire index is falling Google will also fall Google is not like you know made up like something okay what now this is this is like see if you get to buy an individual asset on a downtrend it's great okay if the market is also on a downtrend and panic if the individual stock is also on a downtrend and panic and then you get to buy that is when real wealth is made okay so that's the idea okay that if that happens that's a situation to be really happy about okay because you will genuinely only make money when you are investing at decent prices if you are buying at crazy premiums for example many of you have the habit can't go to buy the Loda you will be building you will be going by like we will buy from Iran money only you will not make any money okay so and I'm going to buy you will only buy E-MAR or whatever right so you might never make money E-MAR see very good example is that if you buy Bursh Khalifa facing apartments you have to pay Bursh Khalifa facing prices okay you will not get Bursh Khalifa facing apartments facing like noida getter prices okay so that's like noida has like lot of getters price I mean that prices you'll not get okay so that's how it goes okay it's like common sense it's not as if that E-MAR if they are building something in front of Bursh Khalifa fully would Bursh Khalifa apartment you'll get it at cheap no you are paying commiserate prices if there is a price mismatch due to sentiments then only you will get something at decent price where you will be able to make money okay this is complicated point I don't know you whether you guys got it or not it was difficult to teach also but these are insightful points that will actually help you make money okay now what happens in like Google's case okay so what are you exactly buying here you are buying something called as uncertainty you don't know what is going to happen to Google's bu
