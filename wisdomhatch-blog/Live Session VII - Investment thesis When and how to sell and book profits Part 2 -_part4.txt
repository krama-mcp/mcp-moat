SUMMARY:
**  
The text is an informal discussion on investment strategies, focusing on the importance of **point of entry**, trend analysis, and disciplined selling. The speaker emphasizes entering trends at the right time (e.g., during downtrend reversals) and holding investments until the trend exhausts. Techniques like SMA (Simple Moving Average) and channel trading are highlighted to identify optimal entry/exit points. A real-world example of exiting mid-cap investments at overvaluation signals is provided. The speaker also addresses common pitfalls (e.g., exiting too early due to minor fluctuations) and advocates for systematic investing based on technical indicators and fundamentals.  

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Point of entry is critical**: Invest when trends reverse (e.g., downtrends bottoming out) for higher success.  
- **Ride the trend**: Hold investments as long as the trend remains intact; avoid premature exits.  
- **Sell based on trend exhaustion**: Exit when technical/fundamental indicators signal overvaluation (e.g., SMA crossovers, overbought conditions).  
- **Use technical tools**: Combine SMA (50/150) and channel trading to refine entry/exit decisions.  
- **Avoid emotional decisions**: Ignore minor fluctuations; focus on major trend changes.  
- **Position sizing matters**: Adjust investment amounts based on market conditions (e.g., 80% invested during strong trends).  
- **Real-world application**: The speaker shares personal examples (e.g., 100% profit in mid-cap 150 by selling at trend exhaustion).  
- **No perfect system**: Adapt strategies (e.g., SMA periods) to market volatility; consistency is key.  
- **Fundamentals + technicals**: Overvaluation signals (e.g., P/E ratios) can justify full exits (e.g., 100% selling).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 take a look, for example, if you are here, OK, so let's analyze like two, three points, OK? Point A here. So there is a cross over which is happening. OK? Now let's assume that we don't know anything about this part. OK, so this part is not there. OK, so we are just somewhere here. Now what should you do at point A? Should you exit your investments? Let's say that you have like 10 lakh rupees in the market. Should you and you 100% invested? Should you exit? Not really, because the trend hasn't changed. Blue line is still intact. OK, if it changes, then we will book some loss and we will go out. OK, now we'll say, can you loss or just go loss? No, here we are assuming that you entered into the trend right. The first step is entering the trend right. OK, you're already on a very good profit. OK, so for example, from here to here, they are already on 36% profits in a matter of one year, which is very good profits to begin with. Now what happens if you lose or lose? OK, so it's not end of the world. So I hope that this first point is clear. We have to analyze trades from the point of entry. So point of entry needs to be solid to begin with. And you get. And what is the point of entry? Bring the downtrend right now. We are here. Now this is the start of a downtrend. Now I don't know to what extent will this go. Now, but are you buying a downtrend? Is your point of entry correct here? Yes, why? Because the trend still us, that the point of entry is correct. It's not me telling you. It's trend tell us. The chart is telling us that the point of entry is great. So should you be mostly invested in this time? The short answer is yes. 80 to 20 you can keep right. Even if you go 100%, you will not be making a loss on 3 to 5 or basis. As long as you are able to ride the trend. For as long as possible. So I hope that this point is clear. If you are over invested in the market here. So top tk, I thought as a cartel of positions and all that. So this is position sizing, which you will learn with time. But I hope that at least I'm able to give you a flavor of what it looks like. Right? That you have to start analyzing thing on when to sell based on your point of entry. If your point of entry is horrid, then it's just bad. I cannot like. For example, if you buy a house, which is worth 1 crore and you buy it at 1.5 crore, so you have already lost the game of investing. I can't do anything. I cannot suggest you anything. Right? I mean, beyond that. So your point of entry needs to be great. Sitting here, we have a great point of entry. Okay? For example, when I bought nifty, which was 15, 16% down, that was a brilliant point of entry. Okay? So that is where you do bulk investing. Okay? That is not the time to sell in the market. Okay? Who sells in the market during such times when the trend has reversed. Only like people who have no clue of what technicals are, what investing is. They are the ones exiting the market then. Okay? Now, many people love to ask that when do you think trend will change? I can tell you trend will change after like how will it change? I cannot tell all that BS. Okay? What I can tell you is that whenever it, I can help you build a system for, you know, sort of tracking this. Now, see, it can go like this also. Okay? Many scenarios can play out. If it goes like this also, then what will happen? Right? To this chart. Right? This entire thing. Right? It will fall like this. Okay? More position, whatever new money we are getting, what, whatever new money we are getting. Okay? So we keep on buying now. Okay? So this is, this is part one that is called as great point of entry. When I say the word point of entry, people just assume it to be a point. Here a point. Now, tell me. Okay? It's not like that. It's basically a buying range. Right? So we are, we are now in a buying range which starts from here. Okay? So, for example, if you are already fairly invested in the market, then should you be buying here? You need to wait to buy here. Okay? Then if it goes like this, should you buy here? No, you buy here. So you mix SMA technique plus you mix channel trading technique and that gives you a great point of entry. So your part one is done. Okay? Brilliantly. And if your entry is beautiful, then 99% of your problems are already solved. Okay? Why? Write the trend. Okay? So, write the trend means that whenever trend reversal happens like this and this and then you just keep on following that and you don't sell early. That is very important. Okay? And third is that you exit like whatever x percent portfolio depending on the market whenever the trend gets exhausted again. Okay? So this is what the right method of selling is. This is literally number one method of selling. Okay? So we execute it on index. This happens at a stock level also. And let me show this to you in action by applying this to mid cap 150. Okay? Mid cap 150. Okay? So we go. We apply the same technique. So this is here. You say right? Where did I sell? Mid cap 150. I sold it somewhere here. Okay? So I sold it somewhere here. Okay? I sold it here. Right? And. Like how much profits did I make? Right? And this was the last big trade that I taken. Okay? So I had entered. A free here. Okay? I had entered roughly here. This trade. Okay? So I made close to 100% profits on mid cap 150. You can watch my videos also. Right? And it will convince you that I genuinely sold somewhere here around this time. I started selling. Okay? Why? Because this trend was getting exhausted. Exhausted. Exhausting. Typically, I would not never sell like, you know, more than 40, 50% and all that stuff on majority of my things. But this I completely exited the mid cap and small cap index. Why? Because what I did was that I applied SMA with fundamentals. Now, what are fundamentals yesterday? What I taught you? Five air bases, three air bases, ten air bases. And then I started to sell it. I started to sell it. I started to sell it. I started to sell it. I started to sell it to my major air bases, ten air bases. If every indicator is telling you that small and mid caps are overvalued here at this point. This will tell you what percentage of small and mid caps stocks or small and mid cap index or whichever index you are trading in. How? What percentage of it should you be selling? Okay? To me, if every indicator is telling me that it's overvalued, then how much should I sell? Hundred percent. Okay? That's a very convincing trade. Okay, so and of course things can go wrong, right? Because I trained can reverse and this up move can continue and all that. But at this stage, I would have at least sold like 70 80%. So that's a minimum. And if you would have actually done 60 70% also, you would not be fretting right now. Right? Even after this. Okay. So I hope that this point is clear. This we have seen an action, right? And you can see me like and you know, selling this right? I'm on real time basis as I was making YouTube videos. Okay. So I hope that this point is clear to everyone. Okay. So I'll not like, okay. So Geerisha and the identity questions because this is a little bit complicated topic. Okay. So yeah. Okay. Hi, Akshath. In the nifty 50 analysis that we just did. You know, I was seeing that you know, 16 to 20, the rally that you showed. After that, there was a parabolic drop, right? And it was a point where, you know, you would kind of, you know, exit the position. Maybe not catch the trend, but you kind of know that, you know, your 50 is lower and your 150 is higher. Whatever. But you know, even between 16 and 20, there are points where that crossover is happening. It's maybe not as prominent, but you see that it's, it's very subtle. So how do you avoid exiting at those points? So for example, if we look at 2017 somewhere, like there is a crossover. 2017, if we go to the 17 or even this, even this point or you know, at 2017, there is one point. How? Okay. So let me let me like quickly explain it. See, so this is made up of two trends actually. And not one trend. Right. So for example, if you zoom in, you will be able to see it. Right. So for example, this is one trend. Yes. So this is one trend. Okay. Till here, you made like almost 30% and then the trend reversal happened. Okay. This is the start of the next trend from here to here. Okay. So you would have pocketed this much returns. Okay. So these are very simple to pocket, right from this point. Okay. And after this, there is a parabolic drop. Okay. Um, okay. Now this is another trend change. Right. So from here to here, it's another 10%. Okay. The idea is not to miss out on riding important trend. This is another key trend, right from here to here. This is a 47% turn up. Right. Now then small small trend change, right. So for example, here to here, there's a crossover at this point, you should exit something. Right. This is not a parabolic drop. For example, this part, this is not a parabolic drop. Okay. Here, you should be booking like 30, 40% profits at least. Okay. And then if you have exited your, uh, because of trend reversal here, you can start making some positions here, here, here, and as per the downward channel, right, buying it here somewhere. Okay. So this is how you invest. Okay. So this, it's not as if that you are exiting the entire index. It's just that key. You have the money and you have, you are taking advantage of a down rate. Okay. So that's what I just one more follow up question. This 50, um, SMA and 150 SMA. If you want to have an evil, even longer term view, would you do like a 50 and 200? Uh, I would personally not, right? Have 50 and 150 works better for me because the markets have become more volatile. Okay. So like on volatile things, for example, Bitcoin, you have to see it even on a shorter time period. Okay. So, but on nifty, 50, etc. You see it on a, you know, 50, 150 works best. Even 200 is fine. It's not end of the world, right? See, guys, I mean, there is no, like everyone builds their syste
