KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Buy in downtrends:** Invest in quality stocks during market downturns for better long-term returns (e.g., Tata Motors, Google).  
- **Avoid greed:** Set realistic expectations (e.g., 12–14% growth targets) and resist chasing short-term market rallies.  
- **Portfolio allocation:** Divide investments into growth (60–70%), defense (slow-but-steady assets), and cash flow (income-generating assets like real estate or FDs).  
- **Financial safety:** Maintain 2 years' worth of expenses in liquid/low-risk instruments (e.g., FDs) for mental peace and flexibility.  
- **Real estate caution:** Avoid overpriced metro properties unless distressed deals exist; prioritize building liquid wealth first (e.g., ₹50 lakh).  
- **Investing mindset:** Focus on wealth preservation and sensible asset selection rather than speculative gains or stock market reliance for income.  
- **Patience pays:** Example: Holding Meta through volatility yielded 150% returns, highlighting the value of conviction in downturns.  
- **Knowledge over hype:** Base decisions on analysis, not market euphoria or peer pressure.

==================================================

 It is still a significant amount. I don't really need that money. How should I let it be there? That is the question. So let me start. Okay. Fairly valued or it's still in the down trend. I did not see this portfolio. I have two portfolios. So should I sell this like? So honestly like I'll try to give like an answer, right? It might be indirect answer. So let me get up. Glad you talked about Tata Motors. So Tata Motors is here. I had not invested one rupee in Tata Motors ever and I was not a big advocate of the phone. Okay. And if you actually study the stock is fell to like 620 in February of 25. Study it in February of 15. It was almost at the same price. So in 10 years nothing has happened on the stock. Okay. This was an artificial rally, right? This entire thing and it is corrected by this. Okay. Now if you bought this stock in a down trend. For example, what is a down trend? This is a down trend. Okay. You made a money. If you bought this stock in an up trend depending on which up trend you bought, right? You might have lost money. Okay. So it's speculated, right? People will show you stories that you know how to get Tata Motors went from here to here like crazy. True, but where did you buy? Right? That's the point. Unless you bought it here, right? Unless you have the confidence to buy the down trend on a stock. For example, Google right now is on a down trend. Do you have the guts to buy it? Okay. That's a more pertinent question to ask. Okay. Now if you have the guts to buy like Tata Motors, IRFC, JP Power, etc, etc. On a down trend, then it's fine. Okay. That's problem one. Problem two is that the moment first panic happens. You will sell it and run away. Right? For example, Google green thing in Madhmiyothi long, right? And then like it's a multi trillion dollar company with a lot of moat going for it, etc. Right? Meta. Right? People were like after my life when I bought Meta at a 50% discount, it went down by another 15% and then was meh. Right? I mean, it's not that bad. It's not that bad. It's not that bad. I don't know. It's a fine 20, 22. Right? Then it went up 150%. Okay. After that point is that don't buy stocks that you can't buy on a down trend. Okay. Only buy on a down trend. That's it. Right? So if you're buying individual stocks, okay. But my question is like, I'm not going to buy it now. But since I have it at a very low low value, should I let that be or should I? It's still at a profit. It's still at a it doesn't matter. Right? So this is a major mistake that you guys make. So tomorrow we have a class on selling. So I'll cover this there. Okay. But it is irrelevant. How much profit or loss you have on the stock right now? Today, where you can deploy your capital well is the question. Okay. So tomorrow we'll cover this. Okay. But I hope that this gave you like kind of an answer. Okay. Awesome. Guys. So let's start like portfolio building a little bit. Right? And I wanted to cover like these 11, 16, 15, 16 points on portfolio building. And see, here, number one point is that don't be a greedy person. Okay. Now what is the meaning of a greedy person? Right? If for example, if you are making 15% profits, then I want like 20% profits. If I make like 20% profits, I mean like 99% profits. So as I know, I'll see right? I mean, be like a reasonable investor to begin with, set realistic expectation because greedy people will get screwed one way or the other. Okay. So this is like a very important point that I can tell you. Right? The goal of investing should be clear to you. What is the goal of your investing? The goal, for example, many people enter stock markets with a very unrealistic expectation that I mean, no, gris, only stock market we will do. No, any cheese. Okay. Unless you have like crazy amount of capital, you cannot survive on stock market income. It's useless. I'm telling you point of blank. Don't do stock market for that. Stock market is a tool for preserving your wealth. Is it easy to preserve your wealth? Yes. As long as you are sensible, as long as you can invest sensibly. Now what is the meaning of investing sensibly that you buy good quality assets, you buy it at a reasonable price. What we have been speaking, okay, two things. Good quality assets go through that 1718 point checklist. Okay. Good price. I hope you are getting a sense that if you are buying down trend, most likely, you will not struggle. If you are chasing growth, right? If you are running, you will get to go back. I mean, that's the problem. Right? So don't run after like a moving bus train, all that stuff. Right? So there is no point in doing that. Okay. Now why do people run after like when markets are running? Because they lack knowledge. Number two, they are greedy. Okay. So that's it. Okay. So that's the reason why it's okay. I'm on the bus. Every minute, we are making only 5% and market is now giving 15%. So we should now invest in the market. Are you guys by gold? Yes. We are greedy. Okay. So like that's a sign that you have to improve with the human. Okay. So that's it. Okay. So why? Because gold has given five, you know, in the last five years, gold has given like 20% 25% run up. And therefore, we will also buy gold. That's greed. Okay. That's no, there's no header like to this analysis. Like if you think about it, okay. You are buying like extremely bullish sentiments. Okay. So number one, that's like basic things. If this is like, you know, an issue, then you need to sort yourself out mentally first. Go to a pass, now go to like, you know, whatever, like inner engineering and whatever you want to do, do that. Okay. And then come back, right? And then go through this 1617 points. Okay. So yeah. Okay. So number one, right from an investing lens, what you need to think about is that you have to divide your portfolio into three growth, defense, uh, cash flows. Okay. So at least these three earlier on in the course, I had shown you like a table, right? That was a more complicated table, right? But then the basic decision that you need to make in terms of portfolio planning is that first figure out what your net net worth is. For example, let's say right now your net worth is, let's say, once a year. Okay. This includes your house ancestral property property that your parents will give you whatever money you have like quite FD. This is that milamilu K one crore. Okay. Now you need to decide that. Okay. I'm young. I'm 30 years old. How much money should I invest in growth? I would say that at least everyone should grow their money at like the base target rate of growth should be between 12 to 14 percent. This is the rate at which your net worth should grow around 12 percent. Okay. Now to do that, right? You have to dedicate at least 60, 70 percent of the money for growth. Okay. Um, okay. Now what about defense defenses like slower growth instruments, right? But it's still at least protect your portfolio. So this can be split between this and this. This is not a, you know, structured thing that I can tell you that, okay, invest like 70 percent per growth, 30 percent for defense 80, 20, all that stuff. That's your call. You have to figure it out. But what I will simply tell you is that if you have cash flow assets, then it gives you a lot of comfort. For example, every FD, I don't do much. Okay. If the market is good in a investible shape, I'll invest all my money. Okay. I would hardly do like any FD. Okay. But two, three good practices that have really helped me. One is cash flow, right? That for example, owning income generating assets. For example, it could be a book. It could be a apartment. It could be a house where I can live, where I save rent. So these are cash flow oriented assets. For example, if I'm getting a cash flow of let's say 50,000 a month, almost guaranteed or if I'm saving 50,000 as rent, what does this allow me to do? Right? It allows me to buy risky assets or growth assets on a downtrend. That's the first mental problem at sorts for me. Okay. The second key, mental problem at sorts for me is that it gives me a feeling of safety. Okay. This is again, a very important aspect. The second practice that I would encourage you to have is that see, just lock away like maybe two years of your expenses. Decide commented earlier into like an FD or a safe instrument and forget about making returns on it. Okay. So for example, if you're early expenses, 12 lakhs and if you can lock away 24 lakhs, what does this allow you? It gives you iteration money. Iteration money means that you can run experiments for the next two years finding a better job, doing a business, whatever it is. And it gives you that mental piece. Okay. Now no amount of return can compensate for these two things. Okay. So therefore I always encourage people to sort these two things whenever the situation is cozy. Okay. A natural question comes that we don't have the money to buy real estate. When should we start thinking about real estate, etc, etc. Now this is a topic in itself and a one hour chat, which I can't do right now. But I'll just try to give you like maybe a few seconds. Number one, I would personally never buy in a metro, right. It makes no sense. It's high risk proposition. Unless you're getting a distress deal. Okay. Even if I were to work in Bangalore Mumbai, there's that stuff. I would still not buy a house there. Okay. It's bloated. It's unsustainable. Right. So a lot of downside is there. Okay. You're not really buying a land. All that stuff. So I would not do that. Okay. And number two, if I would start thinking about real estate realistically, when I have like once here, okay, before that, I'll not think about once here. Okay. First, I'll build at least like 50 lakhs of my liquid money and all that, right. And emergency money, liquid money. So at the ver
