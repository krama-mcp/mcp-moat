==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a fragmented conversation covering various financial topics, including investments in ETFs, real estate, mutual funds, taxation, and economic insights. The speaker advises on direct vs. regular mutual funds, critiques India's debt-driven growth, warns about inflation risks, and emphasizes due diligence in real estate (e.g., Goa, Thailand). They advocate for diversifying assets (gold, international markets) and simplifying finances (avoiding Instagram, using multi-currency accounts). The tone is informal, with personal anecdotes and pragmatic recommendations.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
1. **Mutual Funds:** Switch from regular to direct funds immediately to save on commissions; tax implications remain the same.  
2. **Real Estate:** Requires hands-on research (e.g., scout locations in Goa); beware of inflated prices for foreigners (e.g., Thailand).  
3. **Tax Optimization:** Consider becoming a tax resident in jurisdictions like Dubai to avoid capital gains taxes on US stocks.  
4. **Economic Caution:** India’s debt-driven growth and inflation risks necessitate asset diversification (gold, international holdings).  
5. **Gold & Simplicity:** Physical gold in UAE is safe (legal protections); avoid overcomplicating investments (e.g., uninstall Instagram for focus).  
6. **NPS Critique:** Challenges claims about NPS returns, suggesting tax benefits may not offset lower yields.  
7. **International Banking:** Multi-currency accounts (e.g., in UAE/Europe) offer flexibility; Gift City lacks comparable features.  
8. **Debt Bubble Warning:** Prep for potential debt crises by holding tangible assets (real estate, gold).  
9. **Stocks & IPOs:** Avoid IPOs; buy unlisted pre-IPO or post-listing after market cycles.  
10. **Behavioral Finance:** Separate financial goals (e.g., capital preservation vs. growth) and avoid mixing strategies.  

**Notable Quotes/References:**  
- *"India is a very uncertain market… if a country can ban its own notes, anything can happen."*  
- Arvind Subramaniam’s interview (The Wire) on India’s structural economic issues.  
- *"Build good habits, uninstall Instagram… brain is what allows you to make money."*

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ke it a good choice despite the negatives your call I can show you the math right and that's all I can say rest is your call up it's basically I mean it might be a much booty that you have to do it for example my wife had to donate like some money to I don't know like PM fund or whatever it's not as if that I was increasing or to do it but by default she had to right so there's nothing that she could have done right on that advice for ETF which invests on other countries I will do that not okay NSE unlisted uh unlisted we will touch but NSE over a long time is a solid asset right so then I would add little bit right see guys I'm not a property broker you don't need to buy like a real estate and go and guide us with the location and tell you no I'll I'm not like going to take like so much headache yes or like yeah no I cannot I can just generally tell you what you should buy right I'll just give you like general viewpoint then you come book a hotel live here for like five six days right scout speak with different brokers I'm not going to broker a contact with you you know I just say no yes so that's what I'll say but see good areas right I mean you can pick there are a lot of good livable properties that you can buy it like 78 TLX right in in goa yeah convert a corpus of one crore regular to direct just kill it whenever you can and immediately do it in direct because the commissions are getting paid every year no it's there is no point in you waiting too long because commission see it's like this so the value of your mutual fund in direct and regular will be 100 rupees okay now you kill it today so you'll get 100 rupees now you're immediately transferring it in two three days or whatever that same 100 rupees two regular whatever the tax implications etc you anyways will have to bear it at some point but at least this way you're saving commissions immediately right so different types of index I'll have a class right so if I move to ua and sell my us talks would have zero ltcg for the stock rule by the working in India yes as far as I know it should right because you're moving your account no and you're booking ltcg is applicable when you book profits as long as you're not booking profit now this since it says got to do with rsu's I don't have personal experience on it because I did not work with like a company that gave me stocks right so I don't know practically speaking right but as far as I can say right I mean if you're moving up portfolio right for example if you were let's say an Indian tax resident investing in the us market and then for some reason you move to ua right and then you booked your profits on the us talks in ua then your capital ltcg will be zero so for example like I'm in for example I have like clients who are in India like 100 to 100 crores guys investing in the us market like what's a sensible thing for them to do to become a tax resident of Dubai right for a year when they are booking ltcg yeah so is the current economy good to keep that or repeat again that's a debt measuring question can you can invest in ua basically like you need to open an account with with the Dubai stock exchange right which is I'm forgetting the name what it's exactly called I'll write the process and tell it to you guys okay check that type of information by the sub-savariya public city right so just use public city you'll get all the data you don't even have to look at the internet anymore right so just simply download public city on your phone use it on instagram your knowledge will improve idiots using instagram their knowledge will come down and that will be the biggest alpha on your money okay brain is what allows you to make money not like anything okay so build good habits uninstall instagram that's like key take away from my side okay so I'm a I create content I have never logged on to my instagram account ever yes or yeah buying ipos I don't do it anymore it it just doesn't make any sense either you buy unlisted before ipo or you buy it once it gets listed in the public market goes through a cycle and buy it after one two years okay okay how did you build this what can I do is you made and form okay hopefully this will get covered and you want right with time right so this I've answered physical golden in your UA UA right because everything is you cannot be tricked because you buy gold in UA as a tax resident of UA with your embedded siding so if someone takes you sells you fake gold or they do some guplet Vasi in terms of like the weight you have illegal backing so their shop will get closed so they can't trick you that's the point okay nps 30 see guys whenever someone tells you such complicated plans no key if you are in 30% tax like a 25% break 10 30 in nps how I don't like nps gives you 13% height does it give you like 13% actually after 25% break you're saying me but you're not paying like 25% tax no you're paying like 12.5% so your math is wrong okay every versus liquid fund yes LG so just write to me on LinkedIn okay so I'll do that right no problem every versus liquid fund which one is better see I haven't seen me there is a good more than the near it's a liquid debt fund my cut over it's one and the same thing okay to invest in every of what was more than no not at all right and that's what I'm trying to tell you right I mean don't confuse goals right for example if your goal in the morning is to work out then work out don't mix it with like you know something else okay so if your goal is to meditate then meditate don't mix both of them you do meditation for mental health right and you do hit exercises of weight training for physical health so don't mix the two okay so be very clear you're doing FD investments for iteration capital right that okay it allows me to run don't take unnecessary risk with that if you're going to make like half a percent more invest like maybe 1% more in between no right so when that solves your growth problem right no so so one asked that hey should I add more real estate that depends on the size of your portfolio my point was that I have at least one real estate now because a debt bubble is going to burst at some stage I don't know when maybe like one month maybe 10 years right and whenever that happens and India is going through an inflation crisis we are not seeing it yet why because we are net importers and I don't think that a currency is going to you know sort of get strengthened in the olden times our currency used to strengthen a bit right so I mean if you study the economics behind it right and it becomes like quite evident maybe if I die if I time like I'm in subsequently in today's class I'll try to teach it right so for example that was actually work right in India that in the last two three years I'll pull out the numbers and I'll explain that in the evening class but basically what has happened is that ours is a debt driven growth that we have done right in the last two three years and unfortunately the capital expenditure which is government expenditure so for example you would have seen that government has spent a lot of money on infrastructure government has spent a lot of money in building your ports highways this that stuff but for some reason that is not translating into real growth so that is where the problem happened in India right so for example there is a very good interview by Arvind Subramaniam so just search it on wire I think wire Arvind Subramaniam and you very explains the structural issue on India's economy so this is not a politically connected interview or any of that thing one on one and you can say that okay Raghunam Rajan is politically motivated or whatever but Arvind Subramaniam is a fairly neutral person used to work under Modi Ji right it's not as if that he did not right he eventually resigned and all that you will understand the the structural issue that is going on right so that's a good video I'll post it on the group okay stock picking guess so when to sell a stock we have separate class which type of properties in areas that best way I also allow to get a mortgage and thylane as a foreigner practically you will not get a mortgage to buy a property as an Indian resident anywhere yeah so you need to have money to buy it right but is thylane a good place to buy property I would say yes but you have to do your due diligence because the property rates are different for thine ashyles versus international people and there are specific agencies that cater to selling properties to foreigners and they sell it at much higher prices so as long as you're not buying those type of scammy properties you don't make money on thigh properties okay okay yeah gift gift gift gift to him on Madhupada gift city and all if you want to if you're an NRI he but none of your money outside India that's the simplest thing that I can tell you don't complicate things India is a very uncertain market right if a country can ban its own notes anything can happen I am just being you know very vocal about this topic because other people will not tell you very reality just keep it outside what's the benefit for example almost every bank in Europe every bank in UA gives you the option of having multi currency accounts right so you can have like euro account you can have US account you can have their own accounts right and free of cost right and the conversion between those currencies is also free in that account so for example if you have dirums and if you trust like I don't know euro so your forex trading can happen for free but all these options are not there on gift city as far as I know right okay so okay and I'll try okay ETF I'll cover no there is no class on goa real estate this is top market for sky okay so yeah real estate requires regular effort and older age gets available plus expense when you know close through time creation what about gold which gives you cushion and also no maintenance cost as a preceding you're right I'm not saying that but th
