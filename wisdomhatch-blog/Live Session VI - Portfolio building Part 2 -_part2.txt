SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses essential principles for portfolio planning and investment strategies, emphasizing the importance of starting with a substantial portfolio (50–60 lakhs) before considering real estate. They highlight exceptions like distress deals or family support but stress the need for undervalued, cash-flow-generating properties (e.g., apartments in Dubai/Goa). Key stock market advice includes buying undervalued assets (e.g., Google), avoiding overvalued investments, and booking partial profits to manage risk. The speaker critiques automated SIPs, advocating for opportunistic investing based on valuation. They outline risk-reward ratios (e.g., 10% upside for large caps, 20% for small caps) and stress entry points (e.g., buying indices after 20% corrections). Liquidation (ease of selling) and asset quality (e.g., real estate/villas) are underscored, alongside avoiding FOMO-driven decisions. The talk concludes with exit strategies (e.g., selling at resistance levels) and examples like Bajaj Finance’s uptrend.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Real Estate Prerequisites**: Start with 50–60 lakhs portfolio; focus on cash-flow properties (e.g., ready apartments) in markets like Dubai/Goa. Avoid overpaying.  
- **Exceptions**: Distress deals, family financial support, or dual-income households may alter investment timelines.  
- **Stock Market Rules**:  
  - Buy undervalued assets (e.g., Google) but limit exposure (≤5% of portfolio).  
  - Book partial profits (e.g., 20–30%) to secure gains and extend market longevity.  
  - Avoid SIP automation; invest based on valuations and opportunities.  
- **Risk-Reward**: Expect 10% upside for large caps, 20% for small caps; avoid equities with lower potential returns.  
- **Entry Points Matter**: Buy indices/stocks after significant corrections (e.g., 20–30%) for better upside.  
- **Asset Quality & Liquidation**: Prioritize assets with resale potential; avoid illiquid or hyped investments.  
- **FOMO Warning**: Resist marketing hype; stick to disciplined, value-based buying.  
- **Exit Strategy**: Sell partial holdings at resistance levels (e.g., index peaks or trend reversals).  
- **Example**: Bajaj Finance’s 43% rally illustrates buying on pullbacks within an uptrend.  

*Note:* The speaker dismisses traditional instruments like EPF/PPF, advocating dynamic, valuation-driven investing.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
y least, I should have like 50 lakhs, 60 lakhs portfolio to begin with. Only then I will think about real estate. Okay. Number three, right. There are exceptions. For example, if I get like a distress deal, if my parents are supporting me in terms of buying the house, all that stuff. If my husband, wife are also earning. So maybe their money can go into EMI's. I'll just do growth investing with my money. All those are exceptional circumstances. I cannot comment on that. Okay. So that you will have to think. Okay. But realistically, if you have like 50, 60 lakhs, then you can start thinking about money. Don't even think. Sorry. If you have 50, 60 lakhs, that's the starting point of thinking of a house, right. Before that, I'll not even think. Okay. If I'm buying my first house, I would pretty much buy a cash flow property. Okay. Now what is the meaning of cash flow property? Apartment primarily, right. I mean, if I don't have a very high ticket, okay. A ready property that allows me to move in quickly, right. And save some rent, etc. Dubai is a very good market. Goa is a very good market. So both are very good markets. Okay. For that, if you overpay for real estate, you will never make money on it. Okay. So that's a simple point. It's a useless investment if you're overpaying for real estate. Okay. So these are like basics. I'll tell you. Okay. So then we move to stocks. Okay. So now that's absolute basic of portfolio planning. Yes. And also don't put money in like bad stuff like EPF, PPF and all that. Okay. So this is sorted. This is sorted. Is your cash flow sorted? This is the third thing that you need to think of. Fourth is your asset quality good, right. Whatever you are buying. For example, if you're buying a house, is the asset quality of that apartment good enough. Okay. If you're buying a villa, is the asset quality good? Will you be able to liquidate it? Okay. So liquidation means selling. Okay. For example, many people get excited. Ki Vijay Ki Riyadh Ji is buying like, you know, um, even for Dukam Ptni, like Dho Duru Pewali company and all that stuff. But he has massive liquidation challenges. There are times when those stocks get logged and you can't exit those stocks. Okay. So that should not happen on publicly listed companies on unlisted. It is fine. Okay. So these four five things are there is the price of the asset fair. I help you understand some basics. We'll study more tomorrow. Okay. You should definitely sell something or some part of your portfolio if things look over valued. Okay. I'm not saying that sell entire. For example, you invested one lakh in small cap. It became three lakh and you are seeing it. Ki are, okay, this is over valued. Okay. How much would you withdraw? Maybe like 20, 30 percent book, some profit. Why? Why book some profit to begin with? The reason is very simple that this creates a real cushion. Okay. It increases your longevity in the market. Right. The more investment options you have in hand, the more confidence you have that you can go around and invest in these four, five different asset classes because you are winning. You will only win when you book real profits. Otherwise, if you don't win in reality, then nothing will happen. Okay. Buy undervalued. If something looks undervalued, buy it. Right. For example, Google. Right now, is it undervalued according to me? Yes. Okay. So it's getting to like a very fair valuation. I would say you can definitely consider buying it. Okay. Now, does it mean that you sell your house and buy Google? No. Okay. How much can you buy? Jitya is radaohta krilo. Right. I mean, and never more than like 5 percent of your entire portfolio. Okay. So maybe you buy like, you know, whatever your intended amount is 1, 2 percent, you buy it now. Wait. Okay. Then you buy more later. Okay. SIP versus bulk. Okay. See. SIP. No one has put a gun to your head saying that you have to invest your money every month. Okay. If the charts are telling you to invest, invest. If the charts are not telling you to invest, do not invest. Okay. There is no such automated system. The more you try to automate stock investing, the more useless it gets. Okay. That pretty much defeats the goal of investing. If you step back and see that what is the goal of investing? Well, the goal of investing is to grow money. Okay. Your money will only grow if you are buying things which are undervalued versus overvalued. Okay. And sell things when they are overvalued. You will say that, but no, if I look at the last 20 or history, SIP has always worked. Yeah. In the country, history has become a little unnecessary. Right. You have to invest in the orange, the orange, the orange, the tax, all that sort of that nonsense. Like history is useful for gaining some perspective so that you can predict the future. Don't confuse that. Okay. Last 20 years SIP has given like, you know, X percent CHAR. So it will forever continue to give it. No. That thing has already been done and invested. Okay. So be pessimistic. It's not as if the someone has put a gun to your head. If you find investible opportunities, then only get into the stock market. Okay. And the very basic rule of getting into any stock is the following. Okay. Or any the moment you put money in the stock market, we have to understand risk reward ratio. Okay. Now, for example, if you are going to FDs, what is the risk reward? The risk is close to zero. Okay. And you are making after tax, 4%, 5%, 5% after tax you are making. Okay. Now, if you are going at least to equity, you should at least have an upside of 10%, right? Even on a large cap. If you are going to a small cap, you should at least have a 20% upside. Right. So this is like the absolute basic that you should know that if you are buying any equity and you are not even making like a 10% CHAR on it, what's the point of buying it? Okay. So there is no point in terms of buying it. Okay. If you are buying a small cap equity, there should at least be an upside of 20%, otherwise what's the point of buying it? Okay. There's no upside to buying that. So that is the point. Okay. So, okay. Just a second. Okay. So for example, okay. Here, if you are trying to buy like mid cap index, you're at least expecting a 20% CHAR from this point. Now, when will you get 20% CHAR in a fairly market or a fair valued? So index is something that we always buy at fair value. Okay. Index is not something that we buy in an overvalued zone. Okay. Majority of our money should be invested in index at somewhat fair valuation. Okay. If you are unable to do valuation, then you should at least buy time correction or price correction. What is a good area for index buying? There should be a 20% correction on index. For example, if you take a look at semi-gunner index, S-O-X-X. Okay. Now, here is S-O-X-X. Okay. How much has it corrected from the top? Has it corrected by roughly 28% from the top? Should you go and buy it? You have a lot of economics and finance and finance. I don't have any problem with that. Now, why does that work? Because you're buying a 30% correction on an index in a growth category. Okay. What will happen is that even if the market goes sideways or this index goes sideways, it will at least come back to its previous peak. Okay. Even if it is going in a sideways fashion. So you can still, like if the stock falls from 100 to 70 or an index fall from 100 to 70, that's a 30% correction. If it goes back to 100, what is your gain? It's like almost a 35% percent gain. Okay. Because it's going from 70 as the base. Okay. So the point is that if you're buying, if your entry point is great on a stock or an asset, then automatically it's great. Right. For example, real estate. If you don't understand it much, what is like that one piece of analysis that you can do? For example, let's say that you're buying a villa in a society. Okay. You should go around ask, right? I think we how much did you buy a villa for someone with a two crore? Someone will say 2.3 megadees. So one will say 2.5. Now, if you are getting at 1.8, that same villa. Should you buy it? Yes. Okay. Why? Because it's under one. You're buying your entry point is great. And 80, 90% if your investment is sorted, if your entry point is great. Because trust me, when it comes to investing, the biggest roadblock is FOMO. Okay. There are so many options and everyone is marketing so many options, right? Right? Right from the way real estate to go, real estate to like Gulgaon real estate or to like XYZ stock. Everyone is telling you like great story. So you will be excited about everything. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. So what you cannot do that, right? Just buy things which are at a good entry point. Okay. Very important. Last point, right? On this, that when you're creating a portfolio, you must understand, in fact, two points, right? We should understand the exit. Okay. For example, if I'm buying SOX right now, what is my exit? It's very simple. Right? I will sell whatever I'm buying, at least some profit I'll book here. And this is my Rajas, why will I book it? Because this is the resistance level, right? For this index, right? So the resistance level is here. The moment it touches this resistance, I will book some of my profit. How much? That's affordable. I'm just present, go low, 100% go low, 20% go low, whatever it is that you want to. Okay. On that note, let me talk about Vajaj Finance. Okay. So for example, here is Vajaj Finance. Okay. Now this is an uptrend on Vajaj Finance. Can you see it? Okay. So if you're looking at it on a daily candle, right? The up move has been how much? From here to here, it has given a 43% run up. Okay. If you are, if you're aggregated this position here, at these touch points, and this is the only zone where I buy stocks, right? I mean, as I've been telling you that, if I get to buy this range, I'll keep on buying. I'll buy here also. Okay. I'll buy here also. I'll buy h
