SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses the importance of fundamental analysis in stock investing, emphasizing the need to think like an entrepreneur and focus on growth industries. Key points include judging industry growth potential over management quality, understanding sentiment-driven market multiples, and avoiding desperate investments in overhyped assets. The banking sector in India is highlighted as a growth industry due to its expansion rate exceeding GDP. The analysis framework includes macroeconomic, fundamental, technical, and portfolio considerations.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Think like an entrepreneur:** Focus on growth industries (e.g., EV, finance, consumption) rather than stagnant sectors.  
- **Sentiment drives valuations:** P/E multiples are influenced by market trends and emotions, not just fundamentals (e.g., AI, semiconductors attract higher multiples).  
- **Banking sector example:** In India, banking grows faster (~13–14%) than GDP, making it a strong investment candidate.  
- **Avoid overhyped assets:** Patience and diversification prevent desperation (e.g., avoiding gold during peak bullishness).  
- **Cyclical industries:** Understand cycles (e.g., real estate, PSU stocks) to time investments.  
- **Four-layer analysis:** Evaluate macroeconomy, fundamentals, technicals, and portfolio fit before investing.  
- **Agriculture/manufacturing caution:** Low productivity/capital intensity make these sectors less attractive for growth investing.  
- **Quick check:** Growth industries should outpace GDP; avoid sectors lagging behind.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 will tell you is that how to do fundamental analysis right I'll talk about SBI also okay now now the way people will tell you about fundamental analysis is that you judge the quality of management can you judge quality of management as the government a CEO but others just to say new san al-kaake meh churu right please mehri company investment okay name like one CEO that I'm the biggest thief in the world right please don't invest in my company zero okay they will not so how will you judge the quality of management you will not know okay that's point one point two if you read the last 10 year annual report can you judge what the company is going to do in 11th 12th year you can't okay you can't do it okay you need to have like a business sense okay so you have to think like an entrepreneur right that's the best way of judging the judging the doing fundamental analysis okay for example now how do we think like an entrepreneur okay if you were to start a business today in India which industry will you pick and why EV finance okay consumption okay finance karma okay right so all right things why because tourism education finance EV 2v2 why these are growth industries okay so the first thing that you need to check is that hey is this industry a growth industry or not okay now what is the sign of a growth industry okay so just give me a second okay so what do you do is that what the simple thing is a basically see you will the first criteria of starting a business in India is that at least and all of you picked growth industries correct no one said yeah mehkudana wuganay right I mean analog cameras one on it right so I mean no one said that why because there is no growth rate on analog cameras or the growth rate is very bad okay so you'll always pick a growth industry now why are you picking a growth industry because p multiple you get on growth businesses for example today you might have heard the stories that in 2000 before dot com bubble people were just raising money on powerpoint slides they used to send powerpoint slides and we see used to give them money at a multiple of 100 200 whatever okay why because everyone was excited to chase the trend okay right now what is that trend AI semiconductor machine learning etc right computer vision whatever right so what equation Jenny I right etc right so these are inherently high multiple industries for example kisi ko sir par ni wata ki why the banking p should be 44 or why the banking should be 21 okay it just trades on this range of 21 to 44 or whatever like 14 to 20 44 why because of sentiments okay if more people feel that you know next five 10 years belong to this particular industry like semiconductor etc etc then a higher p multiple will be attached to that industry if people feel that this industry is not going to grow really fast people will not build too much in that industry and it will go away okay from that okay I hope that this point is clear that why does our stock ranges between a certain p this has got less to do with fundamentals and more to do with sentiments okay and understanding sentiments is the fastest way of making money right stock market is less about finance and more about understanding sentiments okay what should you do when people are panicking you should buy when people are very you know happy you should sell okay that's a simple do leave and if you follow this you'll make money okay why because this is pure sentiments okay so that's a bottom line for example some of you ask me that actually are you investing in gold right now no why because people are extremely bullish on gold right now right so why would I invest now maybe I'll wait for like two three years when there is slight correction or whatever then I'll see right now and now then what makes you so patient right some people ask me because it's not as if that I you know I do meditate in meditation in the morning and all that I don't do that right I'm like I'm but the thing is that I have a lot of asset classes to invest my money in right so there are if I'm tracking 20 asset classes I don't necessarily need to go to gold I if I'm finding a good property in Dubai right I'll probably buy that if I'm finding a good property in Goa I'll probably buy that if I'm finding good stalls I'll probably buy that if I am getting good unlisted I'll probably buy that so I don't need to chase gold but if you're a pure gold investor what what does that lead to it leads to desperation the way I was the car over I write I mean you know what okay I've been hardly any growth what will I do gold in me like that because that is going off right so that desperation is why people lose money okay I hope everyone understands and this was insightful okay so okay so coming back right okay so if you take a look at banking sector and if you just ask chat GPT at what rate banking sector is growing in India so it's growing approximately 13 to 14 percent right now is this higher than the GDP growth of India yes okay so for example this means what that if GDP is growing if GDP is growing something like this okay what will happen to banking sector it will grow something like this correct so this is growing faster than the GDP so first for the first criteria of doing growth investing is or putting money for growth is in invest in sectors which are growing faster than the GDP okay now agriculture should you invest in agriculture in India or agriculture and stocks just say many of you get excited sugar industry you stocks are yielding if I'm not yielding and all that stuff structurally right answer is move okay why because the productivity add on agriculture stock is really bad okay in public markets right I mean if you're buying and you know seed stage companies and all that that's different but agree based companies right they are usually bad okay what about manufacturing no manufacturing is a very capital intensive business all those problems are there there's generally checked like criteria number one is that that sector should be growing faster than the economy if that sector itself is not growing faster than the economy and as no track record of growing faster than the economy then there is no point in investing in those companies okay now some businesses are cyclical in nature for example real estate now real estate you would have seen that there is a cycle very good cycle for five six years seven years everyone makes money then everyone loses money for five six years seven years seven years okay then again cycle repeats same happens with PSU stocks that cycle right everyone makes money then everyone loses money okay so you have to understand the intrinsic nature of every asset that you're owning so today we are speaking about banks a little bit like in subsequent classes I would take you through like different different industry then help you understand the nuanced points but to cut the long story short right if you're looking at something like Kotech Mindra Bank the first key thing that you will you will have to understand is that hey is it like a good asset yes it is a good asset I'll give you like an 18 point checklist into night session or like you know next week session which will help you understand how to check whether an asset is good or not and we'll take like a few stocks through that criteria but let's assume that Kotech Mindra Bank is a good asset number two if you have to check valuation that is very very complicated to do it depends on the stage of the company 100 different things but an easier way of doing that in public market because here we are studying a listed company is what that you do for things one is track industry P track absolute P of the company track relative P of the company and finally track the fact whether the earnings are going to go up or EPS is going to go up or not now you have a one here not that jotech with the any shelter here right I mean whether it will grow up and grow up and grow up and you see that EPS is going up it's not as if you know banks are going to shrink in size or whatever you continue to invest not a problem okay so this is the reason why having like something like Kotech Mindra Bank kind of makes sense from a fundamental viewpoint okay now what type of analysis that you need to do on a stock so I'll just zoom out and give you a big picture okay so big picture is that see number one analysis that you need to do is the analysis of macro economy okay if the macro looks bad then you get out okay or you have a 20% hitch 30% hitch second is called as fundamental analysis what I'm just trying to teach you we will have deeper class on this also okay third is called as technical okay analysis and fourth is called as portfolio analysis okay whether it fits your portfolio for example it should not be that okay not Kotech Mindra Bank is great everything is great this also looks good first three factors look great 100% of my money is on Kotech Mindra Bank that should not happen okay so it should make sense for your portfolio also okay so these are like four factors that we are looking at today we are just understanding this sliver of fundamentals I'm just introducing you to this topic okay important point to think is to think like a businessman right and the first criteria to think like a businessman is to pick a growth industry now our banks are growth industry in India yes okay why because tam there is something called as total addressable market that is expanding banks on other hand are also crooks right they charge you on everything right especially Indian banks right and all that stuff so they are crazy profit making businesses right so it's not as a and they are very stable right so again when I take you in the next class through that 18 point analysis I will take you through that story right but fundamentally speaking there is nothing off on banks one very simple way or a quick way of analyzing this is just check if it typically grows faster than the economy okay
