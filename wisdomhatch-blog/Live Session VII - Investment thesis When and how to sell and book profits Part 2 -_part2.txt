SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses investment strategies, focusing on when to sell stocks or indexes. It critiques common questions about selling based on profit/loss percentages, emphasizing that decisions should be based on current valuations and business quality rather than past performance. The author explains concepts like deadweight loss, technical analysis (e.g., trend channels, moving averages), and criticizes the "buy and forget" approach, advocating instead for active portfolio management. Index investments are highlighted as an exception where passive strategies may work. The analysis also touches on tools like churn ratios in mutual funds and technical indicators (e.g., MACD) for evaluating market trends.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Current valuation matters more than past performance**: Decisions to sell should be based on today’s business quality and price, not historical profit/loss.  
- **Deadweight loss analogy**: Dwelling on past investment decisions (like regretting bachelorhood after marriage) is unproductive; focus on present realities.  
- **"Buy and forget" is flawed**: Even Warren Buffett and mutual funds actively adjust portfolios. Passive strategies are more suited to index investing.  
- **Technical analysis tools**: Use trends (higher highs/lows), moving averages (50-day, 150-day), and channels to identify buying/selling points.  
- **Churn ratio**: Mutual funds frequently rotate stocks; retail investors should similarly reassess holdings rather than holding indefinitely.  
- **Index investing**: Can outperform actively managed funds if done correctly, but still requires periodic evaluation for overvaluation signals.  
- **Avoid emotional decisions**: FAQs like "Should I sell at 20% profit?" are irrelevant without contextual analysis of the asset’s current state.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ome VC fund had picked up, let's say, NSC, right? Very early, right? When NSC was smaller, like five years, six years ago, now they might want to liquidate 10% of their portfolio. Why? Because they want to invest only in series a companies, right? Or very small startups, or they want to take this money to the US or whatever, right? So these are the type of sellers who sell it. Okay. So, okay. So cool. I hope that this was clear and this gave you clarity on how to, what type of stocks to buy. And I've written like some theory of mine, right? That what are some things that you need to consider? Or the main point that you need to consider before buying each of these stock types. Okay. Now Bitcoin, I'll not speak that's not part of the course. So we honest, but again, you can think about it from 2x to 5x perspective. Okay. All right. Now, the next point that I wanted to touch upon was selling. Okay. Let's go through some FAQs first, right? The first FAQ is I'm on 20% profit. I bought 10 lakhs worth of HDFC on date X. Now it is at 12 lakh. Should I sell? Okay. Or opposite question is that I'm at 30% loss. Should I sell both are useless questions? Okay. Now, what is the why are these useless questions? Because in economics, there is a concept called as dead weight loss. Okay. So now what is a meaning of dead weight loss? Okay. So for example, if you meet like married people, like married, I must be lucky, right. So then you say, yeah, I'm, I'm, I'm sure you like it. And then I used to have like such a free life. And you know, bachelor's a good job. I was going to be free at the bar and I went out. I wanted to get my team and cars. But I was a little worried about you, you know, it's a one that's the bottom line. That's that thing is done. Okay. Now don't speak about it. Okay. So like living your head is as a bachelor or whatever. Now that thing is done. That face is gone. So just leave it. So there's no point in sort of reminiscing about it. Now females might have similar conversations. I can't bring that perspective in. Because I have no practical experience in that. But this is typically how people behave. So same goes for stock buying. For example, when an LIC ad bought it here, 826, 8 fail, I'm like, whatever, 20% loss, should I sell it? It's useless. You have to make judgment on today's price. You have to make judgment on today's quality of business of LIC on 7th October, 2022. What happened before that is pretty much nonsense. OK, that thing is gone. Now similarly, I bought LIC at 550. Absolute bottom I was able to time. Now it has gone to like $1,080. Now should I sell it? Because I'm sitting on like, you know, whatever, 100% profits. Again, useless. You have to make decision as of late 9th February 2024. Whether it is overvalued, whether it is still a good asset. So these are two things. OK, what again, again, I keep on saying the same thing. Good asset for next two, three years. Good price right now. OK, now is this the way to analyze price that it went to like whatever? X, no, what do we look at? We look at price to equity. We look at what else? We look at trading channels. We look at if consolidation is there, it is hitting resistance support. Is it below it's 200 day moving average? What type of stock it is? What is our investment thesis on it? Exector, etc. OK. So I hope that I'm able to answer FAQs like, oh, this is probably the most over asked question on this topic that I'm sitting on 30% loss on 20% loss on this, that stuff. What should I do? I don't know. OK, so this is this point itself is useless. OK, so how much loss profit you are on? It's it's irrelevant. OK, to this entire discussion. Everyone gets it. OK. Good. OK, now I have like buy and forget type of stocks in my portfolio because I listen to this like this investor. He says that, you know, that you should just buy like five companies that you use on everyday basis and just forget about it. And you know, look after like and give it to your grandkids and all that. Should I buy and forget? No. OK, why? OK, answer simple questions. Quant mutual fund. OK, it has something called as churn ratio. OK, churn ratio. OK, in fact, you can go and check it. I'm not making this up again. Or we'll talk to our friend perplexity. OK, so we go churn ratio of bond mutual fund. OK, what turn over ratio you will just go? I'll just see if they are. Yeah, so this is called as turn over ratio. Now, what does the meaning of turn over ratio? Turn over ratio means that quant active fund buys and sells stock. For example, it started with, let's say, one, two, three stocks. Now, then it turned around these five stocks. Then it turned around, change these stocks five times. OK, so either they did capital rotation. Or they bought it, sold it, bought it, sold it. Or they sold this stock, a replaced it with stock, Z. OK, so they keep on doing that. OK, this is called as the churn ratio or portfolio turn over ratio, OK, in simple language. So what is the lesson that we learned? That is there anything like buy and forget? No, does Mr. Warren Buffett do buy and forget? No, does fund mutual fund does buy and forget? No, any mutual fund does buy and forget. No, OK, if you want to buy and forget, where can you do buy and forget? Index. OK, so that's where you can do buy and forget. And if as a retail investor, if you're only investing in index, it's completely OK. Can you make more money than mutual fund managers just by doing pure index? Yes. If you're not making broad mistakes, you will be able to do it. OK, so I hope that this point is clear. OK, third key point, right? Should you sell your index at certain stage? The answer is yes and no. OK, so now what is the meaning of that? Well, if the if the technical indicators are telling you to sell, you sell. OK, now if things look overvalued, you sell. And there are multiple ways of figuring out if the index is overvalued or not. So index a name and I'll tell you analysis. So let's start with maybe like nifty 50, OK, so nifty 50. And I will now, so there are three or four key things or three or four key strategies that I will collectively teach. So hopefully it will make sense. All right. Wow. So, see, now there are multiple ways of checking if an index is overvalued and are valued yesterday. I had covered some topics like that. OK, you look at it from a five year, 10 year basis. That's a fundamental basis of analyzing index. OK, so I'll not repeat that. Second is that you look at trend. OK, so this is called a trend analysis. And there are two, three ways in which you can analyze trends. OK. Now, I had covered earlier that this is called as an uptrend, right, higher highs. This is called as a downtrend, lower highs, OK, or higher lows, no, lower lows, lower highs, lower highs, OK. So this is a downtrend, OK, this is an uptrend. OK, now this, if you draw like a resistance support line, right, you will be able to guess that, OK, this is in an uptrend. OK, so this particular thing is in an uptrend. And if you are trading the channel between this. Now again, it gives you an indication that within this uptrend, should you be selling or not? OK, so for example, right now, should you be selling index as per the channel theory? So we are here. Should you sell the index here? No, when should you sell it here? So at point A, should you have sold index? Yes, how much? As per your Shradda. OK, I don't know. OK, but here, definitely there is no need of selling index here. OK, is this a great buying point? Maybe, OK, so most likely, yes, OK, is this a great buying point? Point B. Yes, OK, is this a great buying point? Yes, is this a great buying point? Yes, is this a great buying point? Yes, is this a selling point? Point D. Yes, OK. So here, through this, through this channel trading in an uptrend, you can rotate capital. So the question today is that, hey, question we are asking here is that, hey, should you sell index? The answer is, I don't know. Should you sell index at point D? The answer is, yes, is a yes. Should you sell index at point A? The answer here is a yes. Should you sell index at point B? The answer is, I don't know. OK, so it really depends. OK, so I hope that this I was able to answer. This is one way. OK. The second way is something called as simple moving averages or MACD analysis. OK, so this is moving average analysis that we will do. So here, you simply go on indicators and here you will see a simple moving average. OK, and I do a paid plan. OK, so this is free. You can be done on trading. OK, so you click on that. Right? So you click, OK, and you will get lines like these. OK. Now here, what you do is that you go right and you zoom in. Right. And then you have to make some adjustments. OK, so here you go on settings. OK, we look at 50 and we change this to 150. OK, and we use 200. But for the timing, we will just close 200. OK, so we'll just press and click this. OK, and we will change the color. OK, so we'll change the color. OK, so we'll make this maybe black. And this will make maybe. Maybe blue. OK, so this is click. OK, why can't adjust the line size? I don't know how to do that, but I don't think the unpaid plan allows you to do it. OK, now what you will notice is that see, this is now what is the meaning of this black and blue line? OK, so black is 50. 50 day moving average. OK, black is 50 day moving average and blue is 150 dma. We had also spoken about 200 dma and we are looking at it on a daily candle. OK, now what is the meaning of 150 dma? It means the average price of the stock or average price of this index in the last 150 days. OK, 50 day moving average means the average price of the stock in the last 50 days. Everyone with me, nothing, no complication. OK, now here we look for three things. OK, so the first thing that we look for when identifying the trend is that there has to be a trend reversal. See, good thing is or a normal trend is where the blue line. Which is 150 day moving average line is bel
