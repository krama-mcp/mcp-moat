==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses their preferences for living in Thailand over the UAE due to lifestyle differences but acknowledges the UAE's advantages for work and tax efficiency. They compare gold ETFs to physical gold, highlighting taxation and capital control risks. They emphasize avoiding over-leveraging loans (max 33% of income), caution against borrowing to invest, and advocate for financial discipline. The speaker also touches on global investment strategies, favoring the US and China over Europe, and critiques Europe's economic model. They dismiss the idea of an ISB MBA helping relocate to Dubai, stressing networking instead.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Lifestyle vs. Work Preferences:** Thailand is preferred for long-term living, while the UAE is better for tax-efficient income generation.  
- **Gold ETFs vs. Physical Gold:** Physical gold offers tax advantages and avoids capital control risks (e.g., Lebanon’s banking restrictions).  
- **Debt Management:** Loans should not exceed 33% of monthly income; avoid borrowing to invest in stocks.  
- **Financial Discipline:** Focus on good habits (e.g., low EMI) separately from wealth growth.  
- **Global Investments:** Prefer US (tax-efficient for UAE NRIs) and China (asymmetric bets) over Europe (economic challenges).  
- **Real Estate:** Avoid over-leveraging; high Indian borrowing costs make loans risky.  
- **Career Advice:** Relocating to Dubai requires networking, not just an ISB MBA.  
- **Regulatory Limits:** The speaker avoids stock advisory for Indian residents due to licensing constraints.  
- **Market Timing:** Avoid short-term speculation; invest with long-term knowledge and strategy.  
- **Government Spending:** Critiques India’s capital expenditure (e.g., infrastructure) if corruption leads to wasted resources (poor GCF).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
's very structured right so when I I love UAE from that angle right I was never a UAE fan to be honest right I like Thailand more I have a house in Thailand by the way right so like that's more of a lifestyle living right so now I love go and Thailand more right from a long term living perspective but if I am if but if I am working and making money UAE so I would love it it makes no sense why would I you know go and live in like UAE in like UK and you know all that and pay like so much so much in taxes right so yeah kind of doesn't make sense yeah gold ETF same as physical gold no okay what's the difference gold ETF can be taxed we don't think about taxation right so for example if you have if for example Indian government says that gold ETF they LTCG will be 25 what can you do nothing you will have to pay but usually how these taxation works they will give you a base here okay now gold for example if you have gold right physical gold you'll say you made a Dadi gold right I mean this was purchased in like 19 and it's a big old axeloggering right so that is very hard yes so that's that's the difference that's one of the primary attributes second thing is called is capital control so capital control means that for example sometimes what happens is restrictions are put right in the sense that for example you know you cannot you cannot withdraw like gold ETF for some reason right for example Lebanon right so I have like I was working with a client right and Lebanese couple right and in Lebanon there was capital control that you can't withdraw money out of Lebanese bank account right and every day their currency was depreciating so all these complications are there whenever you give your money to government in any form that's government money right so this is something that I'll explain when I talk about main street money versus wall street money so this concept will get clearer but if you're owning gold you should own gold gold ETF is comparable to nifty 50 gold ETF is not comparable to physical gold okay physical gold has different attributes I'll deepen that grid right when I teach more but I hope that this was okay okay the legit has asked me okay no the legit I cannot do like stock advisory right so I mean I cannot review your portfolio Indians dogs I can't do right if you're an NRI then I can work one-on-one with you because I have a license that India is very complicated to get a license I've already put in I don't know how much time will it take okay I'm in US okay not in next class when will you load the next class by tomorrow it should be up right so it should be up then okay the list is just drop me like a link then I'll try to say I don't want any money from you right so it's fine okay yeah capital rotation I'll have a separate class on it right so when to sell is what capital rotation means but from today's example right I mean you need to know how to draw technical so when I teach technical analysis which is probably like next week when we do it next Saturday you will understand more today let's just go topic wise today was macro so if you understood these five six topics that I spoke understood the concept of asset classes then you're good to go and if after today's class if you figure out that it attacks arbitrage I need to take I'm a rich guy or if you say that hey I'm just starting I just switch from regular to direct that saves you money if you stop investing in PFE PFE PFE that's all saving money right in the long time okay I have home loan pay EMI interest to I close it in AMI in the month see you cannot make like 12% in every market type right right now is a good time to do it right I would say but see in India like I'm in try to it really depends on how much loans you have currently right if you have too much loans then it's a problem right so always never have loans more than 33% of your total cash inflows so if for example you your wife family in gum is let's say one lakh then the maximum loan EMI is 33 right so that is fine like that ratio kind of makes sense point three three but if it goes above that you're in danger and try to settle that loan don't worry about returns okay it's about good habits right it's like these are different things for example exercising in the morning right or have being physically active is a different layer of your life compared to spending time with your kids okay one is not taking this is not an and or all similarly having good financial health having low manageable EMI is different from growing your money so don't mix both these things as we become extremely greedy right here I have to double double like that that's one point okay say what's app community is same as youtube community little bit of differences but you'll get enough advantages on this so it's not as if that you need to continue that right so you can enjoy not a problem yeah but yes I mean if you want to read comments and all that is so that's you can retain not an issue in present market scenario is it better to stay on cash or buy stocks which have directed 20 to do it with knowledge that's more important it depends on a lot of things this will get clear right when we talk about like portfolio construction etc okay explain real growth some more what exactly happens in consolidation phases the pumped in money starts showing results yes that's the expectation this is called as capex or capital expenditure and this reflects in a matrix called as a gross capital formation gcf right so what it simply means is that for example opinion government borrows money because technically if it is expanding its balance sheet adding more liquidity into the system it is borrowing money and throwing it in the economy giving it to a dhani so you'll build like more four ports 20 airports whatever it is on public money in a way and public is paying for inflation in the short term now ideally in the long term those five airports 10 ports should add more productivity to India and create real growth right that's what should happen now if there are like you know corrupt idiots right now they will airport degree right so I mean Chathya Giri Raya and all that BSR that is called as wastage of money now that leads to poor gcfs right so poor gross fixed capital formation right I have invested in regular mutual funds six months ago doesn't make sense to switch to direct yes save commissions commissions are poison okay that's a lie simply telling you should you make capital gains tax or rent or rent the returns tax in India's and I like yes you will have to as far as I know in India NRIs are taxed on equities unfortunately right so if you're an NRI then you have you should have a larger portfolio in the US compared to that in India because like especially if you're a UAE based NRI because UAE taxes zero right for US investing so there is automatically at 12 and a half percent alpha which is huge shall I take loan and invest and stock market never okay so like see guys I mean my ideas bad habits can you learn you know there is no point right and then you will take loan you will make money then what do you guess what you will do next you will take even more loans make money then what you will do for the third time for time you'll become a addict okay off loan and one day you'll lose and you will go over what okay so I never do that game do see think about it this way that you are investing for 30 40 50 as I invest for my kids my teach investing to my kids yeah I'll help my which gives them a lot of opportunities freedom don't look at it as a short term profit maximization buying property and app cash if I can pay cash versus loan and put money in market and then take loan what should you suggest see 9% is your definite loan okay so 9% rate so this is not cheap loan that you're getting okay this is like almost a standard loan that you're getting I'll keep both these again it comes down to that same equation see if you're not over leveraged over leverage means that you don't have more than 33% debt on your head then it's fine right it depends on the type of real estate that you're buying what is the idea all that stuff maybe I'll do like a small concept note with you guys right subsequently in the course if time permits but just very quickly right I mean I would say that don't be over leveraged right I mean at any stage in India because in India the cost of borrowing is very very high right don't do it okay sorry yeah don't do this don't do this game if they are living in Europe okay ideally you should invest outside Europe Europe is possibly sitting if you're living in western Europe you're sitting except for like maybe Switzerland right all the countries are like in big trouble right they are expanding their balance sheet now and they are socialist by nature right so due to political due to say it's a cost that they are paying for high cost of living or sorry high quality of living so the quality of living generally in Europe was very high right because you have very good social security but what it indirectly means is that you're not promoting capitalism the way the US has promoted capitalism what it ends up doing is that it leaves were incentive for companies to shift there UK is witnessing that UK should be the first to go and witness something really bad right over the next few years so I would not advocate that you expose yourself to Europe too much right a much better way is China right so if you want to invest somewhere asymmetric bet invest like 10% 15% of your portfolio in China and see the magic okay so yeah that's what I would say okay uh someone is asking me working and looking wanting to shift to Dubai God offers from ISB say ISB MBA will not help you shift to Dubai right that's a problem in Seared can right so what like Dubai is like a very competitive market you have to network and all right so that's more important ISB has nothing to do with Dubai right so that's what I'll say okay employers PF does it not ma
