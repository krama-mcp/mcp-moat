SUMMARY:
**  
The text covers three main topics:  
1. **Dubai's Advantages**: Discusses Dubai's appeal as a global hub due to tax benefits, safety, and a large expat population (notably Indians). The speaker highlights its well-functioning laws and long-term potential despite current hype.  
2. **Investment Advice**: A novice investor seeks guidance on small/mid-cap mutual funds and is advised to focus on future sensible investments rather than past decisions. Another question addresses Bitcoin investment options for Indians, noting high taxes and indirect exposure via platforms like CoinDCX or vested Bitcoin ETFs.  
3. **Technical Analysis & Diversification**: Explains the importance of volume changes in stock analysis and recommends a 30% hedge in foreign markets for Indian residents (or vice versa for NRIs) for portfolio diversification.  

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Dubaiâ€™s Appeal**: Tax benefits, safety, and a majority expat workforce (e.g., 40% Indian population) make it attractive for wealth accumulation and long-term growth.  
- **Investment Mindset**: Past losses are learning experiences; focus on current opportunities (e.g., private banks) rather than recouping losses in the same asset class.  
- **Bitcoin for Indians**: Direct purchase faces high taxes; alternatives include peer-to-peer transactions, regulated exchanges (CoinDCX), or indirect exposure via Bitcoin ETFs (taxed as stocks).  
- **Volume in Trading**: Sudden volume spikes indicate bullish sentiment; useful for entry/exit timing but requires context.  
- **Global Diversification**: Indian residents should allocate 30% to developed markets (NRIs: 30% in India) to hedge against local risks.  
- **Education & Adaptability**: Emphasizes continuous learning in investing and flexibility to shift strategies based on market opportunities.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ai has always competed with US, right. Or Western countries. They wanted to emulate some aspects of it. They have been able to attract a lot of like Europeans, Americans, all that stuff. Right. There are structural advantages to being in Dubai, for example, taxation and all that, right. So I mean, people are able to save a lot of wealth, so which is brilliant. Right. So fundamentally, it's very sound that way. Right. So and also like it is being built on the backs of immigrants, right. For example, the Amarati population is of UAs 10%, right. 90% are expats. 40% population of Dubai is Indians. Okay. So which is crazy. Right. So like to cut the long story short, right. I mean, someone was joking that Dubai is the best Indian city to live in. And I agree right from that angle. Right. So like, as long as you have all the rules, right. And not creating trouble for anyone. It's brilliant. Right. So I mean, I do see like long down potential in Dubai. It's a little bit hyped. Maybe now I don't know. But if you zoom out and see and try to ask that, okay, what three countries are there in the world where laws are functioning for good for normal people. UAE is right now one of those countries where laws function really well. Right. I mean, you'll not be scared to get out on the road at 2 a.m. Right. Name like three countries in the world where you can do that. Right. So, and that's the sign that economy is working for them. Okay. We're inside. Thank you. Harish. Yeah. I actually last year only I started investing money in stock market. So initially I started with mutual funds. So I allocated a financial some money in small cap and mid cap. I mean, I was not having good knowledge at that time. So, but I invested it now. I mean, now I'm getting it by minute and minute, minute, minute, minute. So now I'm in last in small cap and mid cap. So, around 15 to 20 percentage. So should I continue with them or should I exit from them? It doesn't matter. I mean, for example, whatever you have invested, you have invested it. It has no bearing on what is happening today. Okay. Important point to understand is that wherever you are putting new money, you do it sensibly now and forget about the past. Okay. So, take it as a learning. Everyone goes through a learning cycle. Don't make it an ego issue. It's not as if that you lost 15% from small cap. So you have to make it from small cap only. No, you invest wherever the opportunity is. Right. For example, if you see opportunities in private banks, invest in private banks. That's how it's it. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Okay. Giri Shah. Yes. Hey, hi, Akshath. I think you you mentioned this before, but let's say if to start investing in Bitcoin, what are the platforms like I'm an Indian resident. So what platform can I look at? Yeah. See, if you buy Bitcoin directly, right? So one is that there's an underground market to buy Bitcoin. For example, go to Palika, Vazar, pick your hardware wallet and you will be able to do PR to PR transaction and buy Bitcoin. That's one way of buying actual Bitcoin. Okay. Second way is that you go to coin DCX and buy Bitcoin from them. That's exchange method of buying Bitcoin. Now, Indian government keeps a track of it. Therefore, you have to pay crazy amount of taxes on it. So that's a problem. Third option is that you don't buy Bitcoin, but indirectly buy Bitcoin. For example, you buy Tom, vested Bitcoin, West. Okay. Now, you're getting exposure to Bitcoin, but that's not real Bitcoin. And that's also okay, right? Because there is no other option right now. Got it. And what does our taxation look like on let's say, vested Bitcoin? That is treated as a stock as far as I know. So it will be like US stock investing and not Bitcoin investing. Okay. Understood. Thanks. Right. Sheetal Ganshan. Yeah. Sheetal Ganshan. Yeah. The thing is that I'm very new to this. So I need to understand what's the impact of volumes when I see all the charts. So it's the actual impact of volume on stock price. And do we consider that thing in our entry and etc. I will talk about volume a little bit when I teach technical analysis volume does impact. But it's change in volume that is more useful for us as investors. For example, if sudden volume comes in a stock that indicates that that stock is getting bullish sentiment. Okay. Typically speaking. So you aggregate it. Right. I mean at that point in time, whenever you start seeing like higher volumes on that and then eventually it will rise. It's the utility of volume. It's not very complicated topic. I'll teach. Right. Okay. Okay. Thanks. One more question. Like I asked about the minimum investment like in foreign countries. So what I'm looking at for that like you have to make a I'm in your community as well. So you make one video regarding that minimum if we our initial investment is a little bit supposed to and like that it makes sense that we will run at least two like that. So that kind of figure on our own. For example, if your portfolio and index 10 lakhs, then you should at least have three lakhs outside. Right. So consider like if you're an Indian tax resident, everything is an Indian oriented and have 30% hedge to develop the markets. If you're an NRI, then have 30% hedge in India and rest in developed markets. That's how I would do. Right. So. Okay. Okay. Uh, concern. Yeah. I so you answered this Bitcoin West question. So can we assume that there is no way one through West. To just get the exposure to Bitcoins. We have to go to Bitcoin West and get exposure to other stocks who intern our holding Bitcoins now. Anyway. So pure Bitcoins. We just can't. If you buy it, it's really high tax oriented. No. So there is no point in doing it. Okay. Okay. Thanks. Okay. Thank you so much. It was a pleasure. Right. I'll see you next week. Amar O we should be able to buy tomorrow evening. I'll post like all the homework everything. Right. So please take like to it will it should take you maybe a couple of hours to go through all that. Right. So please do that before the class. Right. And next week we meet. I hope it's not very tiring. Right. And yeah. And thanks. Thanks for being like a part of this. Right. I really appreciate right. And yeah, enjoy your remaining Sunday. And we'll meet next week. Okay. Bye.
