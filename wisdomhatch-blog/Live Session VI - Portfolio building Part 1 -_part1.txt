SUMMARY:
**  
The transcript is from a session on portfolio building, focusing on business analysis and value chain concepts. The speaker emphasizes evaluating asset quality (not price) by analyzing factors like brand strength, competitive advantage (moat), and positioning on the value chain. Businesses with strong brands (right side of the value chain, e.g., Apple, Amazon) are preferred over cyclical commodities (left side, e.g., steel, oil). Key points include the importance of high-profit margins, return on capital, and inelastic demand. The speaker also discusses the resilience of tech giants like Google and Meta, highlighting their cash reserves, talent attraction, and ability to pivot despite market uncertainties.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Value Chain Matters:** Prioritize businesses on the *right side* (brands, pricing power) over commodities (cyclical, low-margin).  
- **Brand Strength:** Brands (e.g., Chanel, Google) create intangible value, customer loyalty, and are hard to replicate.  
- **Competitive Advantage (Moat):** Look for businesses with survivability, high ROIC, and unique strategies (e.g., Amazon’s diversification).  
- **Tech Giants’ Resilience:** Companies like Google/Meta have cash, talent, and acquisition budgets to adapt, making them long-term bets.  
- **Avoid Commodities:** Steel, oil, etc., are cyclical and lack pricing power; focus on inelastic, high-margin products.  
- **Documentary Insight:** Brands manipulate consumer behavior (e.g., luxury brands destroying inventory to preserve exclusivity).  
- **Investment Mindset:** "Buy uncertainty"—trust strong brands/moats to navigate market shifts (e.g., Google’s ad revenue challenges).  
- **Practical Metrics:** Favor firms with vertical/horizontal integration, high-profit margins, and low capital intensity.

==================================================

 So in the morning time we studied like how to do business analysis just a very quick taking a look at where okay awesome. All right, so on this class so yeah, so in the VR right so number one point is that we studied like macros right number two we studied like something called as fundamental analysis. Third, we studied something called as business analysis and we will be studying technical analysis. If you add all these four things it gives you a better sense on whether or not you should be buying any asset be it like real estate, be it like stocks whatever you want to do right and finally like I mean you need to plug all this in context of your portfolio. And your personal goals whatever it is okay. So we touched upon like business analysis and I gave you like a list of 17 points right. And one point was remaining which had to do with value chain right value chain. Now value chain simply means that ideally and business analysis what does it allow us to do it allows us to answer the question that the asset or the stock that you are buying is it good quality okay. We are not talking about good price okay good price we will talk tomorrow. Today we are talking good quality okay. Now what are typically good quality businesses which are on the right hand side of the value chain okay. These businesses have brands right. On the left hand side of the value chain we have something called as commodities for example sugar, coal, power, steel, aluminum, copper, oil. We should not be typically buying these type of businesses these are cyclical businesses okay. Now as a general rule we will not buy them. We will buy businesses that are on the right hand side of the equation because what happens is that if you are buying businesses on the right hand side of the value chain. It gives the company a pricing power now brand itself is massively valuable and very difficult to replicate okay. For example Zomato we spoke about the mode of Zomato in the morning. Mode means competitive advantage. What is the difference between Zomato and Akshat? Well Zomato has a strong brand but if Zomato gets into teaching about stock markets you will you take like Zomato stock market course okay. The answer is no because it is not their mode that is my mode okay. So the point is that brands are there everywhere. The stronger the brand the stronger the personal story the better it is okay. And this is where this is very difficult to replicate right. So for example you will say that Akshat you know there are like so many finance influences now. Like so how are you different? Well I am I live a life right in the sense that okay I have I am not just preaching I am actually doing I run a hedge fund right. It's not as if that I am just simply speaking about like a mutual fund with a low mutual fund with all that stuff. I am genuinely investing my money right. 99% of finance influences if you make them speak on camera or like two hours straight life it will be difficult right. How you can only do it if you are truly passionate about like you have been doing this day and day out okay. So that's the difference right. So bottom line is that brands come from personal stories brands come from how someone has cultivated that angle which they are interested in. And you hear the word apple there is a certain certain brand image that you would have right and this is the most valuable thing. So that's the entire idea right. For example many brands there is a very good documentary on Netflix. I am forgetting the name someone just remind me so it's about like you know how you are designed to spend more. It's a very famous document it came like couple of months back right. Please watch it. It's excellent. I am forgetting the name it's like I am not getting it's a story like I know every note I am not able to speak out the name. But anyways as it's a very nice documentary I'll send it on like WhatsApp group okay. So buy out no not buy out something like that totally right. Buy now yes buy now yes that was the documentary it's a very good documentary please watch it. It's about how brands make you buy more how we are programmed to buy buy more and one of the things that caught my attention on that documentary was that there are many brands for example Chanel for example Louis Vuitton they they discard a lot of their inventory and at the time of discarding their inventory they literally cut it. Okay why because if for example you give this inventory to some homeless people okay and homeless people are walking around with Chanel bags okay. What do you think like customers will think okay. So they would rather discard that stock cut it bring it to zero rather than donate it okay. So that's the idea okay. So this is like fairly common practice with luxury brands everyone does it right. Because they don't want to associate a classic case study is that if you prove to the world that you are the poorest person in your society what should you do. You should buy a Tata what's the name that's small car nanow. Okay. Tata nanow you buy okay and roam around in it and that's an indication to the world that you are the poorest person you have worse off than not having a car at all. Okay so that's the reason why Tata nanofield because it was a it was a stamp on your head that you know you can't afford something nice okay. So which is bad right that's the brand image and therefore brands signaling effect is very powerful okay. Whether we like it or not right. So that's the concept of value chain and now I'll not bore you more right. So there was 17 18 points that we studied right please revise the class from the morning. Total addressable market. We spoke about profit margins should be high capital intensive businesses we should generally avoid. We should invest in business where ROIC or return on invested capital slash ROC is higher than weighted average cost of capital. It should be able to do vertical horizontal integration. It should be in in elastic product not elastic products right. The firm should have a brand firm should have a strategy it should have survivability it should be able to survive for the next five years now what is the what is the. What you got winning advantage of something like Amazon. In the brand is very solid right. So Amazon if they decide to do something next it's so wide that that it's amazing okay. Now why you should not bet against companies like Google okay. Meta Apple Amazon because people the way they will think is that for example Google stock right has fallen by like 20 to 23% from its peak people are saying that Google is done why because 60% of its business depends on ad words so sorry advertising revenue. And because publics it is taking away and these LLMs are taking away this Google search advertising revenue right. People are thinking that Google is gone. But the point is that the brand value of Google is massive okay that itself is more valuable than public city okay it's not just about the utility of a thing it's also about the brand value of a thing okay. So brand value is crazy okay so these companies have survived in the social media world where people do not have five minute attention span. And if you associate with a brand right that's all it right so even if tomorrow for example Google decides to buy a sports league and do something with it they have the money they have the cash if they decide to do something else run experiments right for example in US right it's a very clear like they have something called as acquisition okay. All these companies Google meta Apple Amazon they work on a range of experimental products okay. Which we are doing right which we don't even know of right for example like you know how to like send people on like Saturn or something okay so they might be thinking something on those lines all right and they might be running some experiments on that okay. Now employees at Google Amazon Apple they are well paid and they have a very clear road map that our company Google is going to spend money on this what they do is that they leave the company okay build this particular startup come back sell it to Google and join this team okay which was building this okay. So they get rich in the process they get to an equity and they have a very clear understanding and it's completely legal it's not as if that this is illegal if you have friends like Google Amazon meta these companies have acquisition budget so expecting me that I as a stock investor would know that everything that Google is doing is nonsense I would not know okay. So these are like their internal dynamics we don't know how they are going to deal with this 60% like whatever their revenue is where will they pivot to we do know right. The smartest people are working on it let them handle it they will figure it out how to do it okay. Our job is to buy uncertainty okay. So I hope that this point is clear to everyone right. The moat or winning advantage that these companies have is very simple number one they have billions of dollars of cash okay in their repository number two if they want to raise more funds they can easily do it number three they're a brand value is excellent number four they are in tech they specialize in tech they can attract some of the world's best tech talent even now for example if you get a chance to work with publicity versus Google where would you work most likely Google I don't know like some in at least the decision will be split okay that's the power right and because tech is what tech is made on people right so if you have smart developers smart engineers with people who are thinking long term building things and if you have luck going away then you will be able to extend so discounting these companies is a big mistake right now right that's what I would say I'm not sayin
