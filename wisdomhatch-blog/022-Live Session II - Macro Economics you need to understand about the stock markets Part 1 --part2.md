SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses how nations grow wealth by attracting foreign investment through different strategies, such as tourism (Mauritius), exports (China), or selling assets like real estate (UAE). It contrasts India's opaque real estate market with more transparent foreign markets, noting barriers for average foreign investors. The author emphasizes that strategic resources (ports, IPs) are key to national prosperity and warns against selling them recklessly. Examples like China’s export-driven growth and Arab investments in IPs illustrate how nations prioritize wealth accumulation. The text concludes with concerns about India’s reliance on remittances and human capital exports instead of robust economic models like China’s, while questioning the sustainability of stock market returns if government priorities shift.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Wealth Creation Models:** Nations grow rich through tourism (Mauritius), exports (China), or selling denominated assets (UAE real estate).  
- **Strategic Resources Matter:** Ports, airports, and intellectual properties (IPs) are critical; selling them risks national sovereignty (e.g., Chinese control of Sri Lankan ports).  
- **India’s Real Estate Challenges:** Opaque regulations and lack of transparency deter foreign investment, unlike UAE’s open market.  
- **Export-Driven Growth:** Historical examples (India’s past as a "golden bird," China’s rise) highlight exports as a primary driver of prosperity.  
- **Human Capital vs. Economic Strategy:** India excels in remittances and IT labor exports but lacks a sustainable export/industrial model like China’s.  
- **Stock Market ≠ GDP Growth:** Government policies dictate market performance (e.g., Japan’s stagnant market despite liquidity).  
- **Risks of Policy Shifts:** If India/US change focus from boosting stock markets, long-term investor returns could suffer (similar to Japan’s "lost decades").  
- **Follow Smart Money:** Chinese and Arab investments in IPs/real estate signal strategic trends worth emulating.  
- **Corruption as a Barrier:** In India, corruption in real estate and politics hinders transparent foreign investment.  
- **Hyped Local Economies:** Domestic tourism shifts (e.g., UP’s Mahakumbh) don’t add external wealth, unlike genuine exports.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 market, basically you are indicating to the world also that you're open for sale, okay? If you're selling your strategic resources like ports, airports, etc., etc., which are critical resources. Why am I saying critical? Because communication is critical, right? For example, reliance owns geo-hotstar, right? They own the broad casting right of IPL or whatever, cricket. They own a team also, right? So right from like, so this is called as extreme monopoly, okay? It is fine, right? It's entertainment. But now, change the equation. Can you survive without a phone today? No, right? That's a problem, right? So all these are like complicated points, right? So therefore some countries are open for sale. Some countries are not open for sale. They will not sell their strategic resources. They do not want to play the game. Like, you know, my Wi-Fi is okay. So just give me a second. Okay, yeah. Okay. So then comes a natural question that, okay, then why is it that UAE is opening up its real estate market? Because again, like action, they go and acquire like, you know, X number of properties there and you know, you can like, you know, whatever, like create like lot of struggles there and what no. Because that's real estate is hard to manipulate. Okay. So the point I'm trying to tell you is, let's see, the goal of every government, right? Now, how do you typically increase wealth, right? In a nation, for example, this is India, right? So let's meet raw bad map of India. So basically this is India, right? Now, how will India get rich? Right? You have to bring, bring foreign wealth. Now, how do you bring foreign wealth? Either you bring tourism. This is example Mauritius, right? Which is high end tourism entirely tourist based economy. It's bringing foreign dollar into the country. Okay? Or you follow the China model, right? That you are exporting a ton of stuff, right? Which is required in the US and promoting US consumerism. So everyone in the US consumes like Chinese shirt, Chinese phones, all that stuff. So therefore they are paying money to China. So they are getting dollars. They are getting more, Mauritius is getting money through tourism. So that foreign tourism. Or you sell like investments. And these are called as India denominated assets. Okay? So for example, Dubai denominated asset or Dhrum denominated asset is UA real estate. Okay? Now in real estate, the countries get more control. But have you seen like foreigners coming and buying real estate in India? Like what fraction of people would buy? Okay? No, so absolutely not. Okay? So why? Because it is very non-transparent. Okay? It's not as if Indian real estate is bad or foreigners cannot make money in Indian real estate. They can. Right? But the point being that it's very difficult to buy real estate for average foreigner to buy in India. Trump is doing it. And you know, all the Carlisle, Blue, Blackstone is doing it. That's separate. Okay? They have like a huge team of lawyers. But if a random American dude comes and buys properties in India, they will get a lot of money. Right? So I mean, that's the point. For example, Ayodhya Mandirganampe, the people who are bought property, they got wiped out. Okay? So like it was hyperinflated. Right? There is no transparency of data. Under different things. Right? Flip side. For example, you might have heard of the story of a boatman in UP. Right? By Yogi Adityanath Ji that he made like 60 crores or something like that. I don't know how much money he made. Right? So the bottom line is or like, you know, Mahakum generated like I don't know, $5 trillion economy in itself, something of that sort. See, that's stupidity. Right? Why? Because for example, I am an Indian tourist. Now instead of choosing to go to Goa, I went to Mahakum. You took my INR instead of Goa, you know, UP took that. Now, how is that adding like to the economy or how is it making India rich? There is more transactional activity from 1% to the next, but you're not adding any external value. Right? If you go back, study the history of money, you will always see that nations that grew rich, they grew rich by exporting. For example, when India used to be called as the golden bird, our net export used to be 25% of the world trade. So, you know, almost like we used to be a net exporter and that back then. Okay? China grew from a low income country to a middle income country because it was a net exporter. Okay? America exports what? America exports US dollar. Right? How is so every country makes a decision of importing wealth to their nation? Everyone understands that. So this was a nice macro story. I hope it gave you a sense because you guys keep on asking me why is Japan stock market not growing? So what is the relationship between like stock market and GDP? Nothing. Okay? Basically the government picks what mode of foreign investment it wants to bring in India. And UAE government picks what mode of foreign investment it wants to pick and bring in UAE and they accordingly restructure the entire thing. Okay? So that's the point. I think that was a simpler explanation. Now of course, like a lot of complexities can be brought into this right but the general thing is. That if you want to so and what is India like really exporting? Like what are we good at writing like what is that winning USB? India's great at exporting humans. Okay? So for example, like Google CEO Microsoft CEO, etc, etc. Right? So like even it jobs is basically human labor export right which is which are housed in India. Right? But otherwise in terms of remittance, remittance means that I am sending money from UAE to India. A lot of people are sending money from Europe to India. So remittance, my India is number one by far. Yeah. So I'll not go into like all that politics, but I hope the economic side of things kind of makes sense. Right? So that is also fine. Right? For example, if you can export enough Indians outside India and they bring a lot of wealth and send it to India, that's also great business model. Because nothing wrong there. Okay? That will genuinely increase prosperity. Cool. Okay. So I hope that this point is clear. Right? And this solves that out that, okay, why is Chinese stock market not running up? Why is Japan stock market not running up in conjunction to India? Despite more liquidity in the market. So this is the answer. Okay? Because every government focuses on different different things. Okay? Now then comes a very natural question that okay, what about like US and India? These are two best markets right now in terms of the returns that they typically generate. Will they continue to generate returns in the future? Because what if the Indian governments focus changes to something else? Okay? And what if US governments focus changes to something else? Why would they care too much about their stock market? Right? Then all your SIP job, it will become like Japan's story 30 years, I guess, I very zero returns minute. Right? So that should also not happen. So can that happen? It can happen. Okay? Now in India, it should not happen. Okay? Now why is that? Because think about it this way. And let me tell you like story of arms, right? So basically like, Arabs and Jews are the most other smartest and Chinese are the smartest investors. Okay? I have a very simple rule wherever Chinese money is going, follow it. Because for example, they buy wherever they are buying real estate next I'll buy it right and they are buying real estate like left right center. Okay? Very, very smart savvy people Indians are very smart right at least foreign investors in India if their capabilities to invest like 10 crore come engine they will go and buy only two crore come mention. Okay? So very, very smart people. Okay? So very savvy investors, right? So like I mean, these are good guys to follow. So okay? So Arabs, what are they buying? Right? So I mean if you for example look at Emirates Arabs, South East, right? They are buying real estate everywhere in the world. Right? That's one second. They are buying IP intellectual properties. Okay? For example, MMF Joe Fights, Othien, Christiano Ronaldo, Spence a lot of time in Saudi, UA, Dubai, all that stuff. Right? Football rights, Qatar, it did World Cup. Right? I think which was it 2016 or something like they did World Cup. So bottom line being that Arabs are buying like lot of IP's whatever they can get their hands on. Okay? Now, IP's are what? IP's are strategic resources. For example, Pakistan is a defunct nation. Okay? But it has some very important ports which are of strategic importance Chinese on that right? So for example, Chavar port and all that right in Sri Lanka, you have Haman, total port right? So that's again, very important strategic resource. I think Chinese on it right? etc etc. So if a come if a country is up for sale, right? You will get bias. Okay? So the point is that. Okay? Now in India are strategic resources up for sale. That's sad to say, but yes. Okay? So there is nothing I can do on that. I can just tell you the reality. Does it need to be? No, honestly, like I mean, but we have like very corrupt politicians. Chavar is with India not China. Yeah. So what like whatever like so I hope you get my perspective. I'm not like foreign policy expert. But I hope you get my point. Okay? So that's the. Yeah, so bottom line mean that whenever country wants to sell some of its strategic resources, you will always find bias for that right now in India. Unfortunately, if we have to bring foreign wealth, how exactly can we bring foreign wealth? Okay? So one mode is real estate. Can we do it? Well, if you start building bringing Elon Musk in quality real estate, what will there will politicians and corrupt judges invest their money in right? So that's problem one. So yeah, so that's a problem. Right? So they will not make it transparent. It's not as if that real estate can't be made transparent. Right? So that's point problem once real esta
