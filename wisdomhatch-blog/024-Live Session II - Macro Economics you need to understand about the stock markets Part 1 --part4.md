==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses the evolving nature of investment markets, particularly in India, highlighting the shift from traditional stock-picking to speculative and systemic investing. It emphasizes the role of foreign capital inflows, the speculative bubble in Indian markets, and the importance of booking real profits. The speaker also touches on macroeconomic factors like GDP growth, liquidity, and government policies that influence asset prices. The key message is that investors need sophistication, diversification, and active management to navigate these dynamic markets, rather than relying on passive or buy-and-forget strategies.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Foreign capital drives Indian markets:** India relies on foreign investments and remittances to sustain its stock market and INR-denominated assets.  
- **Rising speculation:** The Indian stock market has become increasingly speculative, leading to volatile price movements and the need for active profit-taking.  
- **Diversification and system-based investing:** Investors must adopt diversified, systematic approaches to manage risks and capture opportunities.  
- **Macroeconomic factors matter:** GDP growth, inflation, and government liquidity policies (e.g., money printing) significantly impact asset prices.  
- **Avoid passive strategies:** Buy-and-forget investing is risky in speculative markets; periodic profit booking and capital rotation are critical.  
- **Regulatory and tax dynamics:** High taxes on brokers and mutual funds incentivize the government to keep markets alive, reinforcing their speculative nature.  
- **Global parallels:** Speculative bubbles exist worldwide (e.g., Dubai real estate, Macau gambling), not just in India, but the degree varies.  
- **Sophistication required:** Direct stock/index investing demands knowledge; most retail investors settle for mutual funds for simplicity.  
- **Future outlook:** Markets may consolidate until real GDP growth justifies valuations, emphasizing the need for patience and strategic adjustments.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
eep this on my book okay and then I will go on a trading paid or whatever and I'll find 100 investors for you okay so this used to be the game now what is happening is and what was a difficult step here well the difficult step here was finding buyers because I had to go and convince buyers to invest in a company called as olay electric for example have you guys seen the movie walls wolf of Wall Street Leonardo Di Caprio so there he used to trade like many stocks and then he used to call up people that he know what this is a great company he'll tell you a story about the world okay now what is happening right in 2025 what is happening is that he here are like you know XYZ dumb stocks okay here is like a mutual fund here are buyers and what are you buying you are buying a Cyp okay do they need to even ask you where to invest your money no you can cry right whatever like 1 2% is and the explanation is a 1 2% is a gift of the world of the right so the point being that 1 2% being done by a 4000 different funds it gives exit to crap companies okay so I hope everyone understands this to any questions is so far Dubai literally books one thing I'm not kidding okay so like like everyone know that how much talk is going to move not everyone like but people who build books like these okay why would they kill their own fund reputation that's a very good question and they are not killing their own fund reputation okay what they are doing is that they are giving saw 100 mutual fund guys will come right and they will have 1 1% of whole electric hypothetically okay 100% selling is done you have exposure of 1% companies happy these mutual fund guys are happy because they are taking only 1 2% hit and everyone is taking a hit what is what is a threshold that mutual fund managers want to build not index true index okay the index mean here right for example okay if you don't invest via mutual fund what will you do what are your options number one thing is that you will say index investing I will do but the moment index falls by 20% you will be out you will take a loss because you have a no wise investor you are not gone through that investing cycle then you will go to FDs okay on FD or making after tax 5% okay so that's so what is the baseline that you'll be happy with if the mutual fund manager is giving you 10% okay and that's problem one problem to us that the way index returns are measured it's very difficult to do it okay because some days you top up some days you top down sometimes you will miss up like I said you're right so it's a very complicated game there is no easy way to track all that right unless you are you have little bit of sophistication so what I'm telling you is that there are essentially three options option one is go to FD gold safe safe 5 6% this is what you'll make post tax option to is get to direct stock slash direct index this is option three but here you need little bit of sophistication okay and your option to or the safest is to just say so that's option two and people just simply go with option two okay that's the bottom line and this is where the game gets correct okay now then comes a natural question that okay because I was completing the story as to why Indian stock market will continue to go up because more companies are being created in India right and this is the only channel through which foreign money can come right so for example just say there is a concept of waste management just say your Americans or they and all that they send their nuclear waste to other you know African countries and what not why why because you can dump that shit in US okay you'll get sued okay so they find like some third country into the world but it's like they dump it there okay so the point is that wealth again flows in the same manner right that hey okay they understand that with this market is corrupt like I mean black rock and all can make crazy amount of money if they invest in like you know 100 different such companies and the IPO rules are lacks right so you can IP also fairly easy all that stuff is there right so therefore like I mean because of that fact right a lot of money turns into speculative money and comes here now before I criticize India or like you know criticize this part of India this is the game everywhere it's not just in India it's in the US the degree might be less okay somewhat it's in real estate across the world that real estate becomes speculative okay so the point being that there is some market in the world or some segment which is speculative in nature for example Hong Kong now Macau now what is speculation on Macau gambling okay Macau if you have been right casinos great casinos all that stuff dream 11 speculation pure speculation okay Indian stock market speculative it has become speculative Dubai real estate speculative why because trading fiction is removed opportunity impression is given that a lot of money can be made okay so when investing coalesces with speculation that is where like you know it becomes like a a place where you have to be a little bit more sensible in terms of investing but at the same time if you look at the positive picture because there is speculation going on people are making crazy amount of money therefore the market will be kept alive there is no other option for example Indian government makes crazy amount of returns for sure on stock markets why if you AMC's pay crazy tax you guys pay crazy tax brokers pay crazy tax right if you kill the golden bird right it becomes a problem so this is a topic that we will study subsequently right a little bit more but I hope it gave you a flavor that okay see you know not no asset classes like sacrosanth okay when the narrative becomes super simple you just have to use your brain and not get you know yeah and not just simply flow in the air right at least have some sense in terms of investing where you can invest as a system and make decent returns by decent returns I mean they can consistently beat inflation and you have control over your assets that's the most important part this entire story I was telling you so that you start appreciating the fact that see it's not a buying forget market because the speculative bubble will burst at some stage we don't know when okay but along the way it will give you numerous opportunities to book real profits okay so that's the idea that if you just buy and forget it becomes a problem but if you buy and I will map or be the<|fr|> Commission I mean how FII is DII is actually buy selling all that but to cut the long story short right and if I have to just summarize it in one slide what I will say is that number one right when it comes to India right stock market has to be kept alive because right now this is the only source of bringing foreign wealth in India okay this and remittance right these are two okay that's the only way to make India denominated assets or INR denominated asset or to make people invest in that okay this is one second key thing is Indian stock market is becoming more speculative speculative means that you know asek which sale palette used to be like this now it will become like this okay so the ebzen flows will be huge okay so it's very important for you to understand and book real profits book real profits yeah very important okay third key point it's very important to be diversified diversified and play it as a system and now how to design this this is something that we will study in the future right but these are two three points right and let's get back to the macro class right what I wanted to touch upon and this is where you start understanding the system a little bit more that for example right in the morning session we studied that if you are understanding the concept of this right that okay if too much money is being printed right or what do you call this liquidity has been increased then what happens right the asset prices go up okay now in India also some asset prices will definitely go up as long as this balance sheet keeps on expanding right what would those asset classes be so you have to invest and equity comes out to be at the top even now right so even now equity is a very good structured product where you can grow your money but what I feel over the next few years what is going to happen at least in the decade decade and a half is that that capital rotation while a concept is going to become really critical okay you cannot just simply invest money and forget it has become a much more sophisticated market with time why because the narrative has completely run on SIPs right okay I'll just zoom out now what ends up happening is now if we if we go back to the macro class that hey we studied that car example in the morning that what is that twin goal of the government number one goal of the government is to keep the GDP high or give the notion that our GDP is growing really fast now GDP has two components number one component is called as real GDP and number two component is called as inflation okay technically this is called as nominal GDP is equal to real GDP plus inflation this is usually like the mathematical term that we know for it what people typically do or what stock markets have started to do is that the market will go up it will come down it will go up it will come down it will go up it will come down so this period right for example let's say that this was 2015 and this is 2025 the market did nothing right it just consolidated why did it consolidated because real GDP had to be added to the market or the valuations to start making sense okay so that's typically where we are heading okay so this is the first goal of the government which is improving GDP right and to improve GDP in the short term and to indicate carry on what theta chees is a children all that stuff they simply do what they can print money and they can play around with the rate of money printing okay this is very hard for us to guess that how much money is the Indi
