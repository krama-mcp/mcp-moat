SUMMARY:
**  
The text explains how to identify and ride market trends using moving averages (like the 50-day and 200-day). An uptrend is signaled when the shorter-term moving average (blue line) is above the longer-term one (black line), while a downtrend is the opposite. The strategy involves:  
1. **Entering positions** during trend reversals (e.g., when the blue line crosses above the black line).  
2. **Riding the uptrend** until signs of exhaustion or reversal appear.  
3. **Exiting** partially or fully when the trend breaks (blue line crosses below the black line).  
The author emphasizes that perfect timing (buying absolute bottoms/selling tops) is less important than consistently following the trend. Parabolic (sharp) downturns are hard to exit but can be mitigated by re-entering during downtrends. The method is presented as a way to outperform most mutual fund managers by focusing on index-level trends.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Trend Identification:** An uptrend is confirmed when the shorter moving average (e.g., 50-day) is above the longer one (e.g., 200-day), and vice versa for downtrends.  
- **Entry Points:** Buy during trend reversals (crossover points where the blue line rises above the black line).  
- **Riding the Trend:** Stay invested as long as the uptrend persists (blue line remains above black).  
- **Exiting:** Partially or fully exit when the trend reverses (blue line drops below black), though sharp downturns ("parabolic falls") may be unavoidable.  
- **Profit Potential:** The strategy aims to capture ~60â€“70% gains in uptrends and minimize losses by exiting downtrends early.  
- **Discipline Over Perfection:** Focus on the broader trend rather than timing exact tops/bottoms.  
- **Index-Level Application:** Works best for broad market indices (e.g., S&P 500, Nifty 50) rather than individual stocks.  
- **2025 Strategy:** The author hints at applying this approach to future market conditions (text cuts off before details).  

**Note:** The text is somewhat fragmented and repetitive, but the core principles of trend-following with moving averages are clearly outlined.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ow 50 day moving average line. This is the meaning of an up trend or a normal trend. Everyone gets this. OK, so very simple like gravity. Right, so for example, 50, 150, 200. OK, so gravity is like if you study physics, things come down. So heavy things come down. OK, so that's how you remember this. OK, so this is normal. OK, this is an up trend. OK, so for example, what is an up trend? So for example, this blue line is below black line. OK, I thought of sort of old. OK, I'll just double check this. If I'm speaking correctly, I'll see. So this is 15. So 50 normal will be blue is below and black is above. OK, so gravity, well, it's OK. So this is the normal trend. OK, so what is the normal trend here? So is this a normal trend? Right, October 20 sale, OK, from here. OK, so 2022. So can you say that this is an up trend as per moving averages? The answer is yes, why? Because blue is below black. Everyone gets it. OK, but to ride an up trend, what is the meaning of a riding an up trend? Because that is the goal of an investor. OK, now riding an up trend means what? Riding an up trend means that see, our goal is very simple. And we look for three things. OK, number one, we look for a great point of entry. Now, what is a great point of entry? Right, where there is a trend breakdown? Now, what is the meaning of trend breakdown? Trend breakdown means that normally like blue will be below and black will be above. OK, but when this situation changes, that blue is above and black is below, right? This is, this becomes a point of entry. OK, so for example, this is a breakdown. OK, so you can see that blue is above and black is below. OK, here this part, everyone gets this. OK, now this becomes potentially a great point of entry. And you can build like positions any point. OK, in this entire curve, why? Because a trend reversal has happened. OK, this is a great point of entry. Why? Because again, there is a crossover, which has happened here. Everyone understands? OK, now let's say, now let's analyze this entire phase. OK, so for example, three things need to happen. One is that the trend has to change. Now, what is the meaning of trend changing? One is that black blue thing curve on both should change. OK, for example, here did the black curve change? Answer is yes. Here did the blue curve change here? Yes. So what is your point of entry? It's here roughly here. Everyone understands? It's not here. Right here only black line changed at this point. Not blue line changed its curve. OK, wherever the curve changes, that's the point of entry. For example, here the black curve changed. But did the blue curve change? No, that pointed. But here, here black curve changed and here blue curve changed. Now, this becomes like a point of entry. OK, so roughly here. Right, so you could have entered position here. Everyone understands the small point. OK, OK, right? So this is called as trend reversal. OK, now let's say that we are able to successfully figure out a point of entry. Now, we have entered really well. It is like buying a distressed real estate. That houses were getting sold for one and a half. But now suddenly there is a price dip of one crore. You bought it. OK, now that was a great entry. Congratulations. Now, what is the second goal of investing? That you max out the trend. Right, you OK, till the time the way real estate is running up, you stay invested. Right, and if you sell too early, then you are missing out on gains. But if you sell at the right time, then you are maximizing your profits. OK, so this is the meaning of trend riding. So for example, from here to here, right, here, this is blue line. This is black line. So this blue is below black. OK, so this is normal trend till here. OK. Now, how much profits you would have made if you did that entry? Right, so from here, you would have entered, right? And you would have downward average it also. So conservatively, worst case scenario you would have made 60%. OK, everyone with me. OK, now then what happened? Then trend reverse again. So for example, this is blue line. And this is black. So trend reversed here. OK, so how much losses you should have booked or like, you know, it fell by like maybe say another 10% and you should have exited this particular trade. This entire trade, you should have at least booked some profits, maybe like 60, 70% profits you would have booked, took another 5% hit, right, and got out. OK, or if you are looking for a point of entry, you could, if you have no positions, then this becomes your point of entry. Have you an understands? OK, then what do you do? Well, I will just clear this so that it's easy. Easy visible. OK. So then here we have booked profit and we have concluded our first major trade. OK, so everyone understands how we entered. So that was a great entry point. We wrote the trend. We made like 60, 70% conservatively. Then we booked 5% loss from the top, right, and exited 70, 80% of the positions. OK, now then the trend has changed. Now it fell. So when should we have exited this? We should have roughly exited here. OK, so here we would have exited it, right, and then when do we reenter? When the trend changes again. OK, so this is here we don't enter. But if you have free money lying, then we can enter here also, not an issue. OK, that's, that's OK, if you don't have any use. But our next trade when we will be when there is a trend reversal happening or an uptrend is getting formed. OK, now what is uptrend getting formed? So uptrend is see again the curve changed here, the curve changed here. So this is where the start of trade to happens. Everyone understands why? OK, so this is a point to be fully invested. OK, so here you are fully invested and what is the goal here now? The goal is that you write the trend as much as possible. OK, so we start writing the trend from here roughly. Until what point do we write the trend? We write the trend at least till here. We pocket roughly 46.3% profits. OK, now trend has changed. OK, so now if you are over invested in the market, you will book some profits. Everyone understands? OK, now what is the third trade where should we take the third trade? So for example, if something like this happens, so here it is already in a downtrend. OK, so I will just because it's a little bit complicated. So I will just write it in points. Number one, is it a good time to buy build positions here? OK, the short answer is we are in a downtrend. So the answer is yes, OK, you should definitely buy market. Right, if you are under invested, you should definitely invest like 70 80% of the capital should be invested here. Maximum 20%, you can still keep on the side if you want to perfectly time the trend. OK, so what would be the perfect timing of this trend? OK, the perfect time. So timing of the trend would be that, see, if something like this happens, OK? If we find something like this, OK, so I will just draw this cleanly. OK, so then what could happen is something like this, OK? Something like this, OK, or some variant of this, right? So this is what? This is another uptrend, OK? So where is major money made? Now don't look at it like, you know, like, you know, like a conjuice person, OK? I have to maximize everything. You have to understand the broad picture. See, major money is made when when you are buying a downtrend, number one, and you are riding an uptrend. These are the two most critical things. It's not about buying the absolute bottom or selling the absolute top. It has three parts, number one, buying a downtrend. OK, second is riding the uptrend and third is exiting or partially exiting some partially exiting when the trend gets exhausted. This is the game that we need to play and MACD slash simple moving averages helps us play this game. Everyone with me, OK? And this works beautifully at an index level. And if this is the only thing that you can do, you can keep doing it. OK, when will this completely get over and you can look at it, right? And let me back back test it. Feel, OK? So for example, right, if we study, right, this, right, this is above right here. Please note that the blue curve hasn't changed. So we stay invested, invested, invested, invested. We would have made crazy money between 2016 to this time, OK? Because here is like a trend reversal. So we would have entered here, right? And we would have exited roughly at 65%, which gives you like a CSTR or hopefully, at least 16, 17%, right? Just on pure index, OK? Here is an exit sign, right? Now comes the question that can we exit like, you know, very easily these type of faults, the answer is no, we can't exit these type of parabolic faults. Faults, right? I mean here, what is the meaning of parabolic fault? Parabolic faults is a very sharp fault. OK, so there is a very sharp like within two months, the market corrected very sharply, OK? Now the chances are that you might not have been able to exit this, right? And it's OK. It's not end of the world. But you would take a loss if you don't build more positions here. OK? So two, three key takeaways that I will give you. Number one, if you see a down trend, definitely, build positions. Number two, ride the up trend for as long as possible, OK? And if possible, right? Exit the trend. Unless of course, there is a parabolic fault. OK? In case of parabolic faults, we can't exit the trend. It's very difficult, practically speaking. But if you keep doing these three things consistently, you will beat 99.99% mutual fund managers. Why? Because you're already buying a high quality asset, right? If you're just going to be an active fund, you'll be like individual stocks, you'll be able to get all that stuff. But if you just simply ride these trends, you will be able to beat like 99% of people because you're doing regular profit-booking as per what the charts are telling you. Everyone understands, OK? Now strategy for 2025, OK? So what is happening? Now, what is happening is, right now, if we
