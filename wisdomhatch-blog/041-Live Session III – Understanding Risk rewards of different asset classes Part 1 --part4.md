SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses equity investing, emphasizing that buying stocks means owning a part of a business. It explains the concept of valuation, particularly the discounted cash flow (DCF) model, and highlights its subjective nature due to varying assumptions. The author argues that intrinsic value is hard to determine accurately, citing examples like Zomato's valuation mismatch. They stress the importance of understanding the limitations of valuation models and adopting a humble, pragmatic approach to investing.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Equity = Ownership:** Buying stocks means owning a fraction of a business, like becoming a 0.0001% owner of Kotak Mahindra Bank.  
- **Valuation is Subjective:** Methods like DCF rely on assumptions (e.g., growth rates, discount rates), leading to widely varying estimates. Even experts often get valuations wrong.  
- **No "True" Intrinsic Value:** Factors like economic conditions, government policies, and management decisions make precise valuation impossible.  
- **Humble Investing Acknowledges Uncertainty:** Accepting that valuation is an imperfect exercise helps avoid overconfidence and poor decisions.  
- **Focus on What You Can Control:** Instead of fixating on exact valuations, investors should prioritize understanding business fundamentals and macroeconomic trends.  
- **Example of Zomato:** A professor’s undervalued target (₹45) vs. its market price (₹2500+) illustrates the pitfalls of rigid valuation models.  
- **Bootstrapping to IPO:** Companies often start as bootstrapped ventures (e.g., the author’s "Wisdom Hatch"), grow via VC funding, and eventually IPO, allowing retail investors to buy in.  
- **Why Sell Equity?** Founders sell equity to scale the business (e.g., Shark Tank deals) or capitalize on growth potential, diluting ownership for greater value.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
his does not meet any criteria so I don't put any money here and I don't recommend people put any money here unless it's absolutely mandated for you okay so that's the message that I'm giving okay now comes that this we discuss what can you do if stock market prepares by 50% what will be your uh strategy can you time the market now this is something that I will talk a little bit more about and to understand this what you need to do is that you need to go and study the basics okay so the first key thing is that you must understand and there are 11 points that we will study today and the first key point is that you must understand what exactly an equity is okay so for example if we go here right now you'll see the name Kotech Mahindra Bank okay now what is the meaning of like this market cap what is the meaning of this current price uh how can you buy all this right why should you buy so basically the story starts when Kotech Mahindra Bank was a very small bank okay now this was a business because when you buy a stock or an equity what are you buying you are buying ownership in a business okay so for example if Kotech Mahindra Bank has total number of shares which are 100 okay and you buy 1% of the company this then you become 1% owner of Kotech Mahindra Bank now Kotech Mahindra Bank might have thousands of outstanding shares so when you go and buy one stock at 2079 to piece you are becoming a 0.0001% owner of Kotech Mahindra Bank but nevertheless whenever you buy a stock you become a owner in that company everyone understand this is 0.1 okay now when a company is starting for example I ran a company called his wisdom hatch okay this is an unlisted company it's a very small company okay this is literally like stage one and who owns this company I own this company 100% I have not listed it on the stock exchange I have not raised any DC money I have not there is no private equity fund which is investing in short I don't have any other investor except for me okay so this is a boot strapped company so this is the meaning of a boot strapped company most companies start this way and over time they become like bigger okay then they become even bigger then they become like this and then they eventually IPO and investors like you and me which are called as retail investors we can buy ownership in this company post-type you everyone understands or during IPO this is the most common of buying ownership in a company okay so it's not equity investing it's basically a much better way of looking at it is that you become a part owner of a company okay now do companies have some other route also of now why would company sell its stock that's a very natural question right for example if I'm wisdom hatch and I own 100% of this company why would I sell stock of my company and reduce my equity ownership for example if I decide to sell 40% stake in my company I will only be having 60% of the company okay so this belongs to Akshath and Akshath has sold 40% of the company to others okay now my first step usually is to raise VC funds that I will go to private investors VCs all that and I'll say that boss buy my company it's a brilliant company here is Excel spreadsheet and it will make a lot of money in the next 10-20 years so jump on this growth bandwagon okay so what is it that I am doing I am selling my equity for example shark tank show that you see what is the show about the show is mostly about selling your equity to sharks okay so they are finding these initial set of investors okay now without going and boring you with the details here why would an owner sell his company it's very simple because he's able to add up the multiple to his business okay so for example right now what is the valuation of my company right now what is the meaning of valuation right so it simply means so there are various valuation models okay so very similar to how you know for example valuation models are Excel models okay so what we do is there is something called as present value of future cash flows now let's say that wisdom hatch this year made 10 growth okay next year it is expected to make 15 growths then after that it's expected to make 25 growths so on and so forth okay so it's the case it's already now mathematically if I have to calculate the present value of future cash flows what I need to do is that I have to discount it to 2025 so this is called as present value present value is what 2025 value of wisdom hatch based on my future cash flow projections okay everyone is understanding this 15 growth is not my 2025 revenue this is my 2026 revenue this is my 2027 revenue okay so I have to discount it by a certain rate okay this is called as discount rate or whatever okay now this is a complex mathematical formula and this is also called as hurdle rate or internal rate of return Vagera Vagera and then we get into like that MBA language okay but if we have to just as a layman understand what is the meaning of present value of future cash flows this is what it means right that for example this is a stock right and the current price how do you reach this current price 2076 okay basically someone would have prepared an Excel model present value of future cash flows of Potec Mindra bank okay one just a mangee 100 crores a next year 150 you will go one plus x over two all that formula formula and this gives you present value okay important point to notice that this number is up for debate okay because if I give this exercise to three different analysts they will all come up with different different assumptions okay so this is an Excel model right now you'll get very pissed off that okay you know there is no way to determine the intrinsic value or the true value of a company no okay you can only do mootamotamat right there is no way that you can figure out what the true value of a company is okay how can you check so again perplexity go on perplexity ask a question what is the intrinsic value of Tesla now here when you are running and getting these estimate this is called as discounted cash flow so the model that I just explained you present value of future cash flow that is called as discounted cash flow model also okay now there are 100 different methods of doing this now one method is telling you that a there is the current price should be 46.76 another guy is telling you 69.27 okay based on this method it's 212 based on this method it's 31 based on this it is 69 so you will see these very huge variations okay so which model to trust I think you cannot estimate okay so basically it's just a good intellectual exercise okay so everyone is wrong about valuation now can I prove it to you yes okay for example if you go to a business school top business school if you have been to London business school Harvard and Ferdinsey ad will read a textbook by a professor called as Ashwad Damudran okay so he's the dean of valuation so that's what his only job in life is to do valuation of the company okay now he gave a target of 45 rupees on Zomato okay and if you were to believe him right you would have never bought Zomato and now Zomato is at 2500 300 rupees the point is that I'm not trying to criticize him he's wonderful try it gives you an idea but what I'm trying to tell you is that even dean of valuation is wrong about valuations most of that time and he himself says it it's not just me who is saying it okay so the point being that this is a good exercise for you to understand a viewpoint but you can't base your decisions that okay this is the intrinsic value of the company and therefore should have bite every non-understands okay why now why is that is give you to some funnets right the fund is very simple that's he it is very difficult for me to put the correct value of wisdom hatch okay it can grow like this also or it can grow like this become this and then become this again okay it depends on what things it depends on a lot of tangible and intangible factors now what are tangible factors for example if India's economy is growing really fast if the interest in the stock market is growing really fast then the valuation of my company will also grow really fast now that is beyond my control if for example Indian government decides to give to make like course purchases GST free okay then it will benefit me okay or they will say use the tax free curve right if we want people to study more take more courses become more financially literate and all that stuff if they take opposite action it's a problem 100 different variables it depends on my motivation level for example I don't even promote my courses okay have you ever seen like a paid ad that I run no like I mean I never do it I've never done it right so like if my goal was to make like more money I would have advertised the hell out of my courses right but I never do it okay so like I have no motivation to sell like crazy amount of my courses I make it like big capacity right and run like a number of batches a year and I'm done okay so it really depends on a lot of things right for example if I change my strategy if I were if I had a VC on board they would have asked me to run like paid ads right I mean every day on YouTube you would have seen my ads or whatever right but none of you would have seen any of my ads okay so point being that there are like you know we can't estimate right and what rate the company even wants to grow so there are 100 numerous factors and it's impossible to figure out the intrinsic value of a company people can you can study take 15 20 courses try to estimate it according to me it's a useless exercise so I don't even try doing it right now you'll say that okay then what's a point well understanding what you can do versus what you can't do and being true about it actually solves a lot of problem for you okay the moment you acknowledge the fact that the companies can't be valued you can only come up with a broad range it kind of humbles you and it kind of makes you understand that y
