==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a fragmented discussion on investing strategies, primarily focusing on Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs), benchmark investing, capital rotation, and market analysis. It emphasizes the importance of sticking to benchmark funds (like index funds) due to their historical outperformance of actively managed funds. The speaker also touches on macroeconomic risks in India (e.g., tax policies for foreign investors), technical analysis for identifying support/resistance levels, and portfolio building. Additionally, there's a dialogue about Apple's growth strategy from an employee's perspective, contrasting with the speaker's bearish view due to lack of recent flagship products and rising competition in hardware.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Benchmark Investing Works:** Over 85% of fund managers fail to beat benchmark indices; SIPs in index funds are recommended for long-term growth.  
- **Macro Risks in Indian Markets:** Unpredictable policies (e.g., taxing foreign equity investors) could dampen market sentiment and growth.  
- **Capital Rotation:** Not about chasing short-term gains; it involves buying at support levels and selling at resistance.  
- **Technical Analysis:** Support/resistance lines are key tools; the speaker promises future lessons on drawing trend lines.  
- **Portfolio Allocation:** For a balanced portfolio, 60–70% exposure to fairly valued indices like Nifty is suggested.  
- **Apple’s Investment Thesis:** While employees see growth in retail expansion and proprietary tech, external analysts are bearish due to lack of innovation and rising competition.  
- **AI in Trading:** AI can automate high-frequency trades but requires sophisticated setups; macro investing is more accessible for retail investors.  
- **Employee Stock Insights:** Company insiders often hold stocks long-term due to faith in growth, but external factors (competition, innovation slowdown) may contradict this optimism.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 SIP then I would encourage you to SIP only in benchmarks don't do anything fancy right for example SIP in 50 50 SIP in small cap to 50 third problem in SIP that's the with with age your income grows okay so like wealth protection becomes like a challenge right now Indian markets you need to understand that our market started to get mature after 2000 here 2000 the SIP data is only for the last 20 years sensible data okay now why did India grow in the last 20 years because IT revolution was big Indian workforce were very educated now if something happens to IT industry in India and if there's no secular rally and if there are bad economic steps for example just say India is the only country on earth which taxes foreign investors on equity investments no other country is doing that right foreign wealth they don't touch okay now if you are making these type of knee jerk moves it can really like dampen the spirits of investing in the Indian market for foreigners now all these problems are there right so I mean you know we can't discount it right I mean there might if there are genuine structural issues which you and I can't see today and if you continue to invest in Kushi Kutare I am going to go to Karta then you become like you know yeah then it's probably like you know not a very smart move that's what I had to say you were saying that SIP in the index fund or any EDF like that benchmark EDF like that it is baby yeah when it is not data tells us know that 85% of fund managers don't beat the benchmark yes whenever the 5% 10% fall we find that time we can bulk invest and sit and write okay that's it correct and about the capital rotation also particularly in stocks some run up is happened 100% 50% like that if we find it is overvalued and we can rotate that money into another sector early right is it is it is it is it the meaning of capital rotation and this would right yes also no so capital rotation does not work like you are I have made 50 percent run up therefore I'll rotate no it's nothing like that I mean for example if it is available at a support you buy if it is available at a resistance you sell how to figure this out I'll teach okay thank you so much thank you so Ganya yeah hi sir so my question is once you figure out you are at a good entry level and you want to do your first time a bulk investment right like right now Indian market or Nazda how do I identify how much percentage I can go on the first step it could be very different for Indian and Nazda right now itself right yes so this clarity you will get tomorrow right and we have like a we will teach like we'll learn a little bit more about portfolio building right so tomorrow I'll take you through the basics of portfolio building so that will give you more confidence okay but to cut the long story short so for example right now Naz Nifty is that a fairly valued state I would say so you can you should at least have 60 70 percent exposure to Nifty for example if you want to have 60 let's say out of like 100 units of wealth you have right you want to put like 60 units for growth then and out of that you want to put like 40 units of growth to Nifty then and out of that 40 units you should at least have like maybe around 25 units on Nifty by Monday okay so that's how I'll put it roughly yes Shika yeah hello yeah actually the MP teaching fundamental and technical analysis so would you be able to summarize what all parameters and kind of provide a framework through which you can run a stop to see whether that's one point and are there any AI tools where you can automate your trades or you can use it for analysis something you can't see a complexity can teach you like how to give you quality data that you can absorb that's it that's the utility of that's the utility of AI for us AI can be automated to run high frequency trades but you need to be closer to the terminal and all that stuff that's where another range of money is made either you can make money on absolute short term basis where you're doing microsite trading like Jane's street it is called as hft high frequency trading or you make money by thinking macro now you can't do this because this is very expensive trading setup this is a full time job so I'm teaching you this okay so yeah all right okay yeah they're there hey action so wanted to understand you you showed us today the lines right support lines that you drew on nifty 50 and other indexes how are you deciding on those support lines I actually I have seen this even other people talking about it but I never really understood how people deciding the fall support lines or the so this is called as technical analysis right now I'll teach you this we have a separate class on this but very quickly basically this is called as drawing of trend lines so on Monday to use you I'll send you homework where I have shown on YouTube videos how to draw this right so I will not explain this in the class but if you just watch those two three videos you'll be able to do it okay my skin question is I was an apple I was a software engineer an apple I was a apple employee and over there along with the RSUs we also got the ability to invest like from your salary some amount within apple at a discount level so I ended up accumulating a good amount of RSUs as well as the other apples stocks but I quit the company last year now I see that apple has gone down I don't actually in fact by not even touching anything it kind of grew a lot my portfolio grew a lot so I wanted to understand as to what should be anyone's next step should we just it like that because I have worked internally at Apple so somehow from their technical perspective I can understand where they are trying to grow okay I worked on store building services right so they they created store like they created not only just their retail stores but also they are trying to improve upon or actually expand channel partners stores right so also in US you have best by and AT&T where in those stores you will be able to see by Apple phones or Apple products so they are trying to have more of these channel partners stores especially in Singapore as well as in India they came to India last to last year when I was working in Hyderabad Bangalore and so not only are they trying to build these retail stores specifically retail stores which are Apple owned spaces but they are also trying to increase their number in the channel partners stores so like reliance or chrome or electronics you will find so that is one place that they are growing a lot then they own certain things like you know how you have cashify where you can sell your old old phones and get a discount in the newer phones Apple also has something very similar setup for that in there if you are going to buy from Apple.in they are trying to implement that and they are trying to improve upon that that was another my head interviewed it for so these are the two teams where I primarily primarily worked on and I found that okay apart from that technologically in terms of you know when you see from a from a very outside point of view people would say that okay there is not much change in the phones or in the iPads or in their like but they are technology that they are using let's say the airports that you use which connect directly which connects seamlessly with your phones they have a specific protocol for that they will not share that protocol with let's say Facebook or any other so Facebook if they have their draband glasses you know they will require that Bluetooth to connect but it's not seamless to your phone right but airports are something which are quite seamless so for that to connect you have a specific technology a specific protocol that only Apple owns so these are the technology improvements that they are doing or stuff like that is happening within the company from I'm totally speaking from technological aspect because I was a software engineer yeah so I'm saying that dear I asked they were to explain like I mean so it's not hurt fault I myself like because I want to invest more in Apple like so therefore I was asking for like investment thesis right so it's always good to hear like inside us viewpoints so therefore I think it's always like from till now I have been watching videos and you have been telling like Apple is going down but my gut feeling is like just keep investing in Apple the same thing goes for all the people who are in Google or Microsoft they are like we are not selling right now we're just going to keep investing especially the employees they don't want to sell for like a very long time okay got caught so there was no question guys I mean I asked they were to explain the investment thesis in Apple as per her understanding it's always good to hear like contrary viewpoints I'm not bullish on Apple to be honest like as of now like if I get it at a good price I'll do it so but yeah always good to sort of here my my viewpoint on like Apple is like you know in the US slash China now companies that can create exceptional products are going to win right so that's the idea right so for example b by d if you look at the quality of the electric vehicle they are moving ahead and zooming ahead past Tesla and when it comes to Western customers they don't mind paying like higher price as long as they are getting quality or best quality so the question becomes an apple if you actually go back and study apple the reason why it grew so much in market cap was because they were launching like flagship products almost every third fourth year right so since that is not happening that's problem one problem two is that a lot of other companies are getting into hardware space for example Google is getting into hardware you have metal getting into hardware right so yeah it's been hardware and all that so that's like you know or Amazon getting into hardware in a way right so they have Amazon basics so they can pretty much launch or whatever hardware they fe
