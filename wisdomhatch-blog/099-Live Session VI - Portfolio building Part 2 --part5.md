SUMMARY:
**  
The text is an informal, conversational discussion about investing strategies, portfolio building, and market analysis. The speaker covers various topics, including buying stocks during downtrends, stop-loss strategies, sector allocation, and the importance of technical analysis in investing. They also address questions from the audience about specific stocks, ETFs, and market corrections, while emphasizing a disciplined approach to investing with limited capital allocation per stock (e.g., 5%). The session ends with a preview of upcoming classes on selling strategies, US stocks, and international investing.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Disciplined Investing:** Allocate no more than 5% of capital to individual stocks to manage risk.  
- **Buying Opportunities:** Focus on undervalued stocks or indices (e.g., private bank ETF) based on long-term trends and technical analysis.  
- **Market Corrections:** Classify crashes as >20% declines, major corrections as 10–18%, and minor corrections as 5–7%.  
- **Sector Allocation:** Limit sector exposure (e.g., 20% max) but adapt based on opportunities (e.g., finance-heavy portfolios).  
- **Avoid Overanalysis:** Pure technical analysis is deemed less useful; instead, combine it with investing fundamentals.  
- **Index Investing:** Start with broad indices (e.g., Nasdaq, SOX) before narrowing down to individual stocks.  
- **Capital Rotation:** Emphasizes shifting capital to opportunities rather than holding indefinitely (challenges the "compounding magic" myth).  
- **Upcoming Topics:** Next sessions will cover when to sell stocks, US stocks, and international investing.  
- **Caution on Volatility:** Avoid swing trading highly volatile stocks (e.g., Tesla) and focus on stable assets (e.g., Google).  
- **Practical Advice:** Use tax tools like Console by Zerodha for profit calculations and avoid speculative channels for learning.  

*Note:* The text lacks formal structure, so takeaways are derived from recurring themes and direct advice.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 to plug them in one of these things and write a thesis around it okay. That why are you buying like something like a consistent compounder stock because it is available at a 200 dm why are you buying an index well you're buying it because it is in a downtrend why are you buying a leap of faith because geo is backing it why are you buying a cylindrical stock because it is forming this type of a pattern and you're buying this bottom and this is typically how it operates is it guaranteed that you'll make money on this no but typically this is how it operates and you're putting 5% of your capital on an individual stock max therefore you're doing it okay. So I hope that this is clear right this is where we stop right and I hope that this gave you like an understanding of building basics of portfolio tomorrow we have two classes one we will speak about when to sell your stocks right and do a little bit more technicals right and second we will speak about us stocks right so I will teach some fundamentals there and international investing and yeah hopefully this was useful right and you've got a sense of how to invest right and got some clarity around it cool so I'll take some questions right and we will start from chat right and then we will do it how to catch multivagger you can't okay so there is no header like to catching multivagger okay. It has youtube google cloud yes I mean technically like but you got my sentiment right would you recommend to do this analysis for existing portfolio yes recordings it's on wisdom as website right on your just log in through the email through which you have bought the course and you should be able to do it so when I explained about small case it's like similar to mutual funds there is no difference so wherever you find more comfort you can do that okay. During downtrend what should the stop loss percentage be if I'm doing swing trading see if 5% capital is your stop loss okay so you if you're buying extremely volatile thing right then you invest like maybe depending on your point of entry but for example if you're buying google right now you can invest like maybe 50% 60% capital now of your intended amount right and then wait okay will you be covering lead lag indicators no there is no I'm not teaching technical so I'm just teaching you technical from an investing point so pure technicals are useless right and it's over analyzing what about concept of compounding getting disrupted there's no compounding if the you know if you're not investing see you buy when charts tell you to buy that's how every big investor mutual fund guy is everyone operator it's only retail investors who keep on doing like compounding magic okay so which is which does not make any sense there is always a chance of channel breakdown and therefore you have like 20% capital but channel typically gets broken if the entire market is getting broken and you stay put no I'm not saying that you will never make a noctional loss you will make a noctional in fact you will even make like a real loss and it's okay right but as a system if you're doing this right what I'm telling you then generally your portfolio will win okay nifty bank index to get better clarity on one buying now is good because I again do the same analysis what I was doing for small gap to a small gap mid gap on 15 as that you will see that on a five year basis private bank ETF is undervalued 10 year basis that is undervalued on a channel trading basis it is undervalued so from every parameter it is undervalued right segment for example if one is buying auto sector like a hero but just how much max to invest in a particular segment I would say 20% like but see for example I'm like 70% finance okay so yeah does 200 apply to it is based on consistent compounded type of stocks for example where the business is very clear it's a monop it's a fairly stable business right for example paints business now is stable right so it will follow consistent compounding your coffee can portfolio right if coffee can person would have bought it on to and below to want it dma is portfolio would not have been at the loss but if you buy it whatever levels your portfolio will suffer okay when do you classify the market crash crash means minus 20% right correction would be so there are three types of correction minor major and deep okay so minor correction five seven percent can happen anytime right major means anything above 10% to 18% that's major deep means above 20% because that's the start of a bear run okay I have let's say one cross so tomorrow I'll answer this De-limitation of a de-limitation of the stock market what do you mean by de-limitation I don't know UI path I'm not buying as of now right I sold it a long time back should we do roll over while being in a big loss or should we take brave from stock market upon expiry of futures should we do roll over I don't trade in futures yes I'll teach you 50 day moving average one to day tomorrow okay that's good for buying and selling okay within stock portfolio any percentage recommendation between different types no so you buy opportunities that's it okay so for example you're buying consistent compounders at good good level spite okay so for example right now there is an opportunity honestly huel etc so you buy it not a problem okay I own a lLP should I invest from my personal account or open a trading account in the name of the company I do I have not done it myself right I mean I would I think lLP would be more more sensible right because the corporate tax are generally low but since I'm not done it I'll advise you to check with us here okay good candidate for swing trading no it's very volatile assets volatile assets you do not typically swing trade stocks like Tesla or Microsoft Tesla I don't even touch right it's very person specific stocks so there is no point Microsoft Kavasi Karna and say the way I do it for Google okay how you decided so I decided on a three to five year basis ten year basis so that was my contingent point okay so it's not swing trading it's more about capital rotation right as long as your capital rotating it's good for you okay or at least you'll be able to better absorb my commentary right reads I will not invest because in India as a you know half of the real estate is black money and reads will just be value your property right so there's just too much problem okay so don't invest in reads in India Jupiter wagon I have no idea I exited 20% last week should I enter again now you buy it at support so if it is at support you buy it okay if I were to start building portfolio how would I narrow down on bouquet of stocks to analyze you don't start with stocks you simply start with index okay so you start with index you buy Nasdaq SOX maybe like some top stocks that you're aware of HUL Nestle Google Microsoft so this is where you start yeah no private bank ETF any ETF index you can buy more that's not an issue because ETF is a collection of different stocks what's the percentage between what's the percentage between if t 15 private bank and I didn't get the questions on the revision of look sub-a-seat I have no idea there doesn't impact like to be honest in couples formed you're already the opportunity to come back again but do you look only lost the opportunity no you did not lose the opportunity right I mean it's consolidating sideways right so you are not losing the opportunity yeah Google that's that's okay that's it's only 25 30% done and moreover like you can check all my buy-in sales so in the US market I can give buy-in sales calls right because I'm legally registered in UA it as an advisor so there I can issue like buy-in sales recommendations you can see my entire portfolio how much profit loss I am where the market is what I bought last so we have created like an entire dashboard okay tax resident of Singapore and it's you FI it makes sense to trade from it you have not much no it would not make any
