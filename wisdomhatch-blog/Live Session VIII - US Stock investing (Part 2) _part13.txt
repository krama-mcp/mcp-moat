==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker expresses skepticism about investing in Indian IT companies (like Infosys and TCS) due to the rise of AI (LLMs) automating coding tasks, leading to reduced demand for human capital. They predict a 40% shrinkage in workforce needs, making the industry "de-growth" and unattractive for investment. Instead, they highlight opportunities in AI-focused ventures (e.g., data centers, localized LLMs for India's multilingual needs) but question whether traditional IT firms will benefit. They prefer investing in NASDAQ over Indian IT due to higher growth potential and conclude by emphasizing caution toward the sector.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **AI Disruption in IT:** LLMs (like ChatGPT) threaten the service-delivery model of Indian IT firms, potentially reducing workforce requirements by ~40%.  
- **"De-growth Industry":** Traditional IT services may face declining profitability, leading to lower valuations (e.g., P/E ratios dropping from 25 to 10).  
- **Shift in Investment Focus:** The speaker favors AI infrastructure (e.g., data centers, Nvidia partnerships) and localized LLMs for Indiaâ€™s language diversity over traditional IT stocks.  
- **NASDAQ Preference:** Given the risks in Indian IT, they advocate allocating funds to NASDAQ for better growth prospects.  
- **Uncertainty for Traditional IT:** Profits from AI adoption may go to new players (e.g., "geotech") rather than established IT companies.  
- **Caution Advised:** The speaker avoids Indian IT stocks currently but remains open to revisiting the sector later.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
man capital is not required in AI 2.0 that's the problem right so therefore I am not bullish on ID anymore in India right so therefore I'm completely out right so because the primary advantage of InfraSys TCS etc was that this was service delivery model now if entire coding can be automated through LLMs what exactly will like a tier 3 engineering college student would do one part is the LLMs can give you the base code yeah right but still it would need to be tweaked that is I've been I've been working in industry long enough to know that everything does not work as it is supposed to be there will be the human element obviously it will come down right now if I'm if I'm deploying 100 people I might be deploying 70 60 people that's given so let me let me just stop you there so that's a shrinkage of 40% so this is a degrowth industry right so I would invest in other jobs might might come up and I'll just follow it up yeah I just heard a money is basically setting up the largest data center in the Amnagar and he's going to work on the LLM model that is what he's investing in he's tied up with Nvidia to buy a lot of the accepts to do all that stuff so I see some organization since India is a from a language perspective we have so many languages and other stuff it can be a good growth story to pick up but again on the service side ifs will still be shipped from US or China so see Jamnagar's LLM story kind of makes sense for products that require localization so that is the play there makes sense 100% agree but who would take the profits would it be the IT companies or would it be like I don't know geotech if they launch geotech okay so it's geotech right it's not like traditional IT companies that exist today they are screwed okay so that's how I think okay now because of you yourself as saying that you know what the workforce is going to sharing from 100 to 60 that's the problem right that the industry now is in a de-growth the moment industry goes into a de-growth it means that the P of infuses will not be 25 it will be 10 which means that there will be 50 percent correction on stock so it gives me like more bullishness right on my thesis that okay put zero money on IT right now so I don't know and if you um juxtaposed compared to NASDAQ right so the natural question comes that if I have 100 dollars to invest why will I put it in Indian IT why not NASDAQ there is no rational argument I take both sides I'm investing in NASDAQ through and there's an ICICIF there's a direct fund I'm investing but they don't take lumps on I want to purchase but that's the problem but yeah just thinking the IT next would be a good pick at this time thanks I don't know like I mean I honestly like speculative you can be right I can be right I I don't know like but this the risk seems high for me right so when I'm not touching it right so thanks maybe I'll touch it I'll like six months I don't know like so let's see okay okay thanks guys it was a pleasure really enjoyed like interacting with all of you I will stay in touch via whatsapp I'll also share my email ID etc in case you want to reach out thank you so much for giving your time but I really appreciate it thank you thank you appreciate appreciate thank you everyone okay take care and best of luck and if you need anything I'm always available right happy to help right and let me know okay thank you take care
