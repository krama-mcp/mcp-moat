SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses their investment approach, emphasizing minimal daily time spent on portfolio management. They explain two key strategies:  
1. **Capital Rotation** – Trading within a stock's consolidation (sideways) and breakout phases by identifying support/resistance levels and adjusting positions accordingly (e.g., buying at support, selling partial positions at resistance).  
2. **Stop-Loss Strategy** – Used by traders to manage risk, focusing on price action and predefined risk-reward ratios (e.g., 2:1 reward-to-risk). The speaker illustrates this with an example stock (Motilal Oswal), highlighting support/resistance levels and exit points.  

The speaker contrasts their method (long-term, fundamentals-driven) with day trading (price-action-focused), stressing automation challenges in active strategies.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Minimal Time Investment**: The speaker spends ≤2 hours/day on investments, avoiding constant portfolio monitoring to reduce stress.  
- **Capital Rotation**:  
  - Trade within a stock’s range (buy near support, sell near resistance).  
  - Retain core positions while taking partial profits.  
- **Support/Resistance**: Key levels are identified by connecting price touchpoints (peaks = resistance, troughs = support).  
- **Stop-Loss Strategy**:  
  - Requires active monitoring; exit positions if support breaks (e.g., 2:1 reward-to-risk ratio).  
  - Example: Motilal Oswal’s 13% upside potential vs. 7% downside risk.  
- **Investor vs. Trader**: Long-term investors combine macro/fundamental analysis with technical levels, while traders focus purely on price action.  
- **Automation Limitation**: Active strategies lack automation, making them time-intensive.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
like contrary to popular belief I don't invest like more than two hours of my time managing my investments every day because it's not as if that I like no sort of yeah it's a very boring job because I don't like looking at like portfolio all day getting stressed all that nonsense okay so I don't look at my portfolio also for days okay but I'll explain both okay so capital rotation is fairly simple to understand right so capital rotation means they say for example okay so a stock goes through different ranges okay so I'll just draw it right so what you will what you will notice is that see this was a range how to draw this range we learn different right we'll learn later like I did not draw it well right so this is touching this point right so this is one a range this is another range okay now this is a sideways range that it touched this it came down touch this came down touch this came down so this is sideways consolidation okay this rectangular box is getting formed okay this is a called as consolidation phase of the stock okay this phase is called as breakout why is it called a breakout because this was the triangle and it broke this channel and it went up okay everyone understood the meaning of breakout and consolidation okay let me just give you one more example so that this point becomes clearer right and what you will usually see is there is consolidation and then there is breakout okay so for example or breakdown so three things can happen for example this is consolidation this is break down this is break out okay this is consolidation this is break out this is break down okay if you expand this this again it comes like a consolidation phase and this is a breakout phase this is a consolidation phase this is a breakout phase this is a consolidation phase this is a breakout phase this is a breakdown phase so everyone understood the meaning of consolidation breakout breakdown okay so therefore I'm seeing saying that if a stock is consolidating now what is the meaning of this it goes up like this look like the condemned up down up down up down so what do you do Okay, you cannot guess. For example, you in capital rotation, the meaning is that you trade this channel. Okay, so for example, if you're buying HDFC today, you have to have a very clear indication of the range, right, where it will, it could potentially move. Okay, for example, right, if you are looking at it on a, and we can, and for this, we can use monthly, or if you're doing, if you are a long term investor, then you can use monthly candles, right, that will make kind of more sense. Okay, or weekly candles, right, and let me just eliminate this and let me tell you how to draw channels first. Okay, we are looking at it on a monthly basis. Why? Because we are long term investors. What you do is that you pick the lowest possible point and connect, right, connect as many dots as possible. This gives you a trading channel. This becomes support. Okay, then you pick these top points and connect them and draw the straight line. So this becomes your resistance. So this is called as a resistance. This is called as support. Everyone understood what is the meaning of resistance and support? Now I'll just zoom in this. But I'll have to draw it again. Okay, so this is easier to draw. Right. Now we are here. So what should you do? Should you add positions? Should you not add positions? Well, it's neutral position. You don't know anything. Okay, if it falls here, what should you do? You should add. If it goes here, what should you do? You don't sell. If it goes here, what should you do? You should add. If it goes here, what should you do? You should sell. Then comes a very natural question. Should I sell everything? For example, if I'm adding let's say 100 units here, how much should I sell here? Okay, sell 50. Okay, if it falls here, add another 50. Okay, so now you have 50, you have 50, 50, 50, you have 50. Right, so you go back to 100 again. Okay, if it goes here, you sell another 50. So you're left with 50 now. Okay, and then it gives a breakout. So this 50 will turn into 18. The point is that you're retaining positions and taking out profits from the market. Everyone understands. And this is a capital rotation strategy. Now natural question comes that no, no, no, no. Okay, for example, I sold 50 and then the market went up. I'll just double check if anyone is on the phone. I hope everyone understood what is the meaning of capital rotation. Everyone got it. Now second exit strategy is called a stop loss strategy. Now this is what traders use. And scope of that is at Tevazi. Now if you have little bit of time and if you have energy to monitor, now that is great. So you can definitely do that and you can do it even on riskier assets. Now for example, let's go to something like let's say, Motilal was for. So, Motilal. So. Now this is this has a parabolic fall. You can see, right? If you look at this, this is literally a parabolic fall. The stock corrected by literally like almost close to 44%. Right. Now what you will do is. So this is on a monthly candle. So number one, you know trading strategies are built either on weekly or daily basis. So let's look at daily candles. Right. So this is daily candles. Okay. And you look here. Okay. Now what you will notice is that see this is a major support. Right. This point. Why because the stock has touched this went up. Touched this went up. Touched this went up. So this is a major support. So I will just draw it. Here. Okay. And right now this is also support. Right. So this particular support where the stock is trading. Right. Here. Now if you are a positional trader, you will say that you know what? I am going to run Motilal. This is the future. Right. I mean, I don't care. Okay. What I am doing is that this is a fundamentally okay stock. What I am going to do is and I am going to invest heavy capital. Okay. So for example, I am getting to buy it here. Okay. And I will invest, let's say for example, if my network is one crore, right. I will invest 10 lakhs on this stock here. Okay. And I will create a two is to one reward system. Now what is the meaning of two is to one towards system that other double. Okay. Right. So I will exit. And if it falls by like a ratio. So for example, the what is in that I'm looking for example, the net if it falls for the brakes, this support so little bit it breaks it, which means you have a fit or me to the right. Is it the stock somewhere here if it breaks this orange line and I will have to track it. Okay. So this is the problem in this strategy that I cannot automate it. And this is the reason why I don't do this much. And that is a good money to be made. Now is there an upside of two is to one on this. The short answer is yes, because for example, the next major sub resistance on the stock is where. For example, it has started to go up the next major resistance on this is roughly here. Right. So this is a major resistance point. So the upswing on this is 13.89% and the downswing right now on this is 8%. So this is almost almost two is to one strategy every year understand. Okay. Right. No, okay. So like, I'll explain it again. Okay. So where are we? Right. So we are here. Yeah. We are here. Right. I'll zoom it again. This green candle. This is where we are finished. Okay. What is the support line for this? This is one support. Now why am I calling this orange line a support? Because the stock touched this. The stock touched this. Right. It went back up. It touched this. It went back up. So it has touched this went back up. Touched this went back up. So this is a support. Everyone got what is the meaning of support. Right. Again, here also touched this went back up. Touched this and this was an inflection point. Touched this went back up. So this is a major support. Okay. Now what I do is that. That I calculate my risk to reward ratio. Okay. And I look for at least. Two is to one or roughly two is to one reward. Otherwise, if it is one to one risk, it is not it is a bad tree. Okay. There is no point in taking it. So I will buy. Right by taking risk. So what will you calculate? You will calculate the next resistance point. Okay. Resistance point happens up. So you齱 me, I am right. So we are here right now. Correct. Now next. Resistance point is this right? So here. Here. Now why am I calling this a resistance point, because the stock touched here went back up. Touched here went back up. Almost touched here. Went back up. Touched here went back up. So, that's here, went back up. So, so on and so forth. So, this is a major resistance point. Here, my reward is roughly like 13.0 something percent. Okay, we might not be able to take a draw here. It will turn out to be roughly 13.0 something percent. Now, at what point should I exit my loss? Right? If it falls to the previous support line. Now, what is the previous support line? So, from here to here, if I calculate, the previous support line is almost 6.5, 7 percent. So, the down, so the loss on the strategy is minus 7 percent. The upside for me is almost 14 percent. So, this is a 2 is to 1 trade. Abhimat Gullaya, 13.0, 2 is to 1.0 now. So, like, Motamoda mat. Okay? So, I hope you got the picture. So, here you have a very clear exit. Okay? So, let's say that you invested 10 lakhs and no, you don't need to subscribe to anything. This is all free. Because I'm just showing it to you for free only. Okay? So, I hope that this point is clear. So, either we do capital rotation or we cut our losses at a stop loss. Okay? Especially on uncertain stock. Now, this is the difference between traders and investors. The traders look primarily at price action. Right? So, price action means they will purely judge by a price. They don't even know the name of the stock. Okay? But in our case, what we do is that we do macro analysis. We do fundamental analysis. And we are going to do a macro analysis. We do fundamental analysis. And we apply this strategy
