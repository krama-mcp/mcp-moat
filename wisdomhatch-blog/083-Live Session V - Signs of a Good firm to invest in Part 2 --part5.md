SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a transcript of a financial class or discussion covering various investment topics, including business analysis, stock valuation, ETF investing, real estate (agricultural land, Dubai, Goa), and macro analysis.

Key points include avoiding overcomplicated investments, understanding weighted average cost of capital (WACC), and building positions in US stocks for long-term gains. The tone is informal, with the speaker acknowledging some parts may be "boring" but stressing the value of the insights provided.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Business Analysis:** Follow a structured approach (17 points) to analyze a business and create an investment thesis.  
- **Valuation & WACC:** Weighted average cost of capital (WACC) combines debt and equity costs (e.g., 14% for a company) and is crucial for valuation.  
- **Investment Tools:** Use tools like *screener* for research, but avoid automating trades; focus on macro, business, and technical analysis.  
- **ETF Investing:** Nifty 50 can be bought via ETFs like *Nifty Bees* or mutual funds; ETFs are preferred for liquidity.  
- **Real Estate Warnings:**  
  - Agricultural land is legally complex and illiquid in many Indian states.  
  - Small-city properties face low demand and liquidation challenges.  
  - Dubai’s market is highly deal-specific; avoid overpriced or impractical properties (e.g., one-bedroom pools).  
  - Goa’s market suffers from overdevelopment and high prices compared to alternatives like Chandigarh.  
- **Stock Market Caution:** Avoid impulsive stock buys (e.g., ITC); use checklists for discipline.  
- **US Stocks & Rotation:** Indian markets may stagnate; US stocks offer better long-term opportunities.  
- **Defense & Small-Caps:** Avoid sectors like defense and auto; small/mid-cap indices are at attractive levels.  
- **Bitcoin ETF:** Consider as an alternative to direct Bitcoin investment, but research thoroughly.  
- **Patience & Research:** Emphasized repeatedly for real estate, stocks, and macro investing.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
up if it does not win in defense if it does not win a contract then it goes to final point I'll explain in the evening class what is the meaning of valuation and but yeah I hope you enjoyed this class right it gave you clarity right on how to analyze a business if you just to do these 17 points then you create an investment thesis and an investment canvas which I'll continue in the evening class but at least it gave you a sense this was like an mini MBA which I was able to hopefully wrap up in like two hours right but I hope it was not boring right it was slightly boring class I know but at least it now what you do is that you basically take a printout of this right these 17 points and you'll stick it wherever your mind stocks okay and every time you have the urge of mind a stock for example ITC career career career career so at least just quickly go through these 16 17 points it will give you like that level headedness okay so that will give you an understanding the WSE simply means that weighted average cost of capital so a company takes both debt capital and equity capital and if you weighted average it for example 50 50 8 right so then the weighted average will be 0.5 into 0.5 whatever the cost of debt capital is an equity capital is and then you get like a average number for example the cost of the or the for example the weighted average cost of capital for a danias 14% okay so you can search this number on complexity for example just simply go and check a danias say how to use screener I'm already teaching you I'm doing it in front of you you don't need to become like an expert screener right and there is no automation that you can create on screener that okay my stock you know falls to this and I buy this no that's automating trades going to be not on screener screener is a research tool okay so you just create like basic screens that I will teach you tomorrow right what filters to use sometimes and even that is not required honestly you have to do like macro analysis which we learned last week business analysis what we learned today now technical I've taught a little bit tomorrow we will do a class on selling stocks so that will get covered there okay so I mean if you combine these three four analysis fundamental business technical macro then you get like a good sense what to buy what to avoid okay please clarify how we can buy nifty 50 you buy something called as nifty bees and I have to buy BWES you can buy it directly on your trading account where you buy stocks from or you can buy it in mutual fund format but I buy ETFs because they are no that because I do like I mean I don't track my mutual fund portfolio much so since I'm tracking like ETF usually right on my because I track my stocks so then it's easy to liquidate okay I hope that this is how to buy agricultural land agricultural land is very complicated it's just see agricultural land it's it's complicated don't get into all that there are a lot of laws around agricultural land you can't buy agricultural land as an outsider in many states agriculture is a state subject okay so and diloy it open big office looking okay buy property on small city not at all okay so see problem with small city properties is that you will not get buyers no one more aspires to buy a property in qualia where I am from okay so even qualia people don't want to buy property in qualia okay so like I'm from qualia so I don't want to buy property there so liquidating it is a big headache okay so there right and if you buy it in like and the deals that you get are like pathetic for examples even if you get a buyer they will say that we will give you money after three years okay so give us a property now and after three years and I make money from the shop I'll return to the government's madness okay companies like power grid opium I don't think that's the case okay excel sheet I'll send you guys right now so don't worry yeah provide yeah excel sheet is everything is written on that sheet so I'll conclude teaching and send it to you right tomorrow thought day after has like this last week I did some further direction on text off so yesterday you know that Nalta corrected by 2.5 percent so it's so just in a week's time of me delaying and you know so you I will be saved 2.5 percent of your portfolio okay so now that does not mean that I can help you time the bottom okay so you have to start buying at some point right so tomorrow I'll cover more from this private bank ETF view that so you can buy that sometimes you sell 50 percent and I'm dying to sell 10 percent how to decide okay tomorrow okay thank you Sophia okay so problem with HDFC securities is that they will charge you a lot of commissions right and 0.5 will charge you less or any zid 0 discount broker is going to charge you less so 0.5 stocks grow anything that you can use typically I would say that right because the what do you call the brokerages fairly like well regulated industry so I don't think that there is any right there how do buy districts properties and you okay so you have to be very active in the property market okay wait wait a little bit okay I think very good deals I want to come up in the by soon okay so it's just have to be a little bit patient keep ready your cash by and after analysis they're already coming up in fact right so I mean I'll few deals have started to come up now right so it really depends on what type of portfolio you want to create in UA buying properties in UA is hyper complicated there are so many choices you'll go mad okay so be very very careful with what you buy okay here but overall very solid property market you can make money right no doubt about that but just be very patient don't give into the form okay and there will always be like great properties to buy in Dubai Goa has opposite problem that properties do not come up in Goa that's the problem in Goa right so no one wants to build right so like that station okay where can you see exact back so just search on publicity buying index versus ETF ETF is an exchange traded fund of an index okay so there is a difference between ETF and mutual funds okay you know it's same right I mean honestly like for investment purposes one and the same there are differences like you know what is what you call expense ratio and all that okay how is good now property market for from future perspective my simple question to you is that if Goa is almost as expensive as Charger not getting okay so I find Goa Charger to be less expensive than Goa and it's Charger is 10 times better than Goa right and we take quality of food pathways you can walk whether right six months a year at least right so people look at desert it you know so no I mean right now if I go down right I can walk and sweat will also not come right so I mean it's like that nice right now in March it's up on November to March you a is pretty good right I even I was surprised with the weather so I don't see the value and like you know Goa and all it's surviving now because it's concrete jungle right I mean if you look at like the green age green acreage right on construction to green age ratio it will be very low in Goa at least Delhi's greener compared to Goa right so Goa is now developed because Delhi was overcrowded right so that's the point right and I don't know till what point that will continue right but yeah so okay can you provide us material okay so this I'll provide defense stocks I don't buy right and I'm very happy like I mean with some broad beds that I've taken not to buy defense not to buy data motor strength all these stocks have gone through like massive selling like small cap mid cap index at very good levels very happy with that move that was like I think the move of the last three four years right entering into US stocks now exceptionally good time now to start building positions in US stocks that's where money will real money will be made in the next five six years okay so I feel that Indian markets will go sideways if you can't capital rotate you'll not make money in Indian market but in the US market long term you can make money right so yeah I mean if you can sort of you know start building some positions there kind of makes sense okay on a listed companies okay I will suggest okay Bitcoin ETF you can buy if you're not buying direct Bitcoin see it's not like you know Dubai property market right it's not as if that this is a good time to buy like any property in Dubai that will never be the case right I mean even when the market is deeply distressed in Dubai whenever that happens it's not as if that you will you know every property is worth buying in them right there are such there are so many complicated options for example people are building one bedroom apartment and builders are building one bedroom apartment and putting a private pool in that in terrace now I'm never seen like such hideous structures in my life okay so like it's ridiculous right I mean why would someone do swimming in like a one bedroom balcony okay it makes no sense there's no logic to that right I mean and people are buying such properties okay so it's madness okay I bought like a property in business right right right in front of me there is like an elington building coming elington is a wonderful developer okay but the price point right I mean I bought it at 1600 PSF right the rumps right and that's building in front of me selling it at like 3200 PSF 50% more right so it's crazy if you're paying like that type of margins to a builder right there will be nothing for you okay you are buying at like 10 year future price okay so you have hard time like so it's it's very very important to study it Dubai real estate market is more complicated than India's stock market it was a done so I'll say right so it's really like deal-wise you have to make a call yeah how do buy ETFs okay how do buy nsc this I'll tell okay so even we'll pick okay I've been picky nifty these last five days this should
