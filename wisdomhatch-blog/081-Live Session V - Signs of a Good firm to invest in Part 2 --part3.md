SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses the importance of investing in businesses with strong pricing power and premiumization potential, rather than those competing solely on cost-cutting. It highlights examples like HUL, Nestle, Apple, and elite-focused companies (e.g., PVR, Dream Folks) as resilient due to their ability to raise prices and cater to aspirational or inelastic demand segments. Conversely, commoditized industries (e.g., sugar) or businesses reliant on price wars (e.g., Page Industries) are deemed risky. The author also advocates for long-term investments in hospitals and insurance in India, citing their growth potential amid industry maturation and inelastic demand.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Pricing Power Matters:** Focus on companies that can consistently raise prices (e.g., HUL, Nestle) rather than those trapped in cost-cutting cycles.  
- **Premiumization Over Commoditization:** Brands with aspirational value (e.g., Apple) or elite customer segments (e.g., PVR) sustain profits better than commoditized products (e.g., sugar).  
- **Inelastic Demand Benefits Sectors:** Hospitals and insurance are highlighted as resilient due to non-discretionary spending, with long-term growth potential in India.  
- **Avoid Price Wars:** Businesses like Page Industries (underwear) or Nirma (detergents) struggle when forced to compete on price, eroding margins.  
- **Regulatory Risks in Food:** Companies like Amul may face challenges due to tightening regulations (e.g., palm oil bans), emphasizing the need for sector awareness.  
- **Valuation Timing:** Buying strong businesses (e.g., HUL) during corrections or below moving averages can offer opportunities in sideways markets.  
- **Pharma Complexity Avoided:** The author avoids pharma due to intricate supply chains and lack of brand dominance, preferring simpler, predictable sectors.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ue products for example value housing is going up right trend went up like crazy. Why because it's competing in a value segment. So businesses that can cut cost and are becoming extremely price competitive those are generally bad businesses to start with for example if you have to go. Like trend is a temporary phenomenon according to me right. So for example if you have been a dedicated customer of decathlon so for example I'm one of the firm advocates of like decathlon when decathlon started the quality of their t-shirts was exceptionally good. So you can go and check right absolute pathetic quality alright so it's not so the area where we are getting us that a lot of businesses have started to cut cost okay. So in this type of an environment you should stick to companies that will not do too much price cutting over the next five six years. Now what are some examples. So even before that right why should we not buy businesses where there's a constant price cut. The reason is very simple that there is only an extent to which you can cut price okay and those businesses always go out first for example if page industry has to constantly keep on cutting price of its product right at the back end. There's only a limit to which they can cut price right so they are following anti-premiumization and there is no way for them to sell like more underwear by saying that you know what we are making like premium underwear there's no one gives a shit okay so like they want to save cost on this item right. It's just a product where brand does not matter that much right to them okay. On the flip side if you are looking at let's say Apple products then yes brand value is still there people would still flaunt their Apple laptop or Apple watch or whatever okay so some value is still there right. Amul I yeah so Amul could be like one of those things okay so that is there right but again here the issue is that because of the use extensive use of palm oil. A lot of rules titling tightening by FSCI for example analog paneer right I mean for the last 10 years both the money for India right because you do not get soft money anywhere else in the world right whenever I used to come to India I used to eat like this are a one you try to put this like a mock paneer or whatever like analog paneer right so then. Now it's proving that it's bad for you so yeah when I'm vegetarian honey to the as you are they have an after the scam so they can I just eat like seafood that's it to be so. Oh so you could just legal that I think but whatever right so what I mean that FSCI is tightening a lot of rules so and food products are one where a lot of rule tightening should happen right and is likely to happen going forward okay so. Okay so anyways I hope that you got this point okay so here by forms that have some kind of pricing power for example when you're ready to go right if you go and check right at you are right every year they were doing like a 10% 12% price hike of their product okay. For example and this can again be checked right so just simply go and ask for flexibility by what percentage HUL it's prices of products so poorly designed question but hopefully it will answer okay. Okay. Okay in 2020 and HUL products by increase. Okay so detergent and soap increased by like 3 to 14 8 to 12 so the point is that they are still raising their prices by like you know 10% a year okay this is faster than inflation right now if a company is able to increase its product faster than inflation that's a healthy sign so Nestle HUL art companies that can still do it now why can they do it because they are somewhat aspirational okay. For example NIRMA went out because it was catering to like a lower segment customer right and HUL came and it ate a lot of NIRMA's business right not was a simple thing so the point is that the customer segment that you are targeting see recent correction give or I'm not talking again I'm not talking about price right right now right and HUL like I'm in a long term basis if you zoom out and check right for example here. If you zoom out right I mean leave these like small little corrections here and there right what has changed I mean it has not changed much right it has consolidated from here to here therefore it becomes a buying opportunity now it will again move up right and this was like the shrinkage of the middle class that has happened after 2020 yeah from here to here okay so of course even HUL will get hit even Nestle will get hit okay that's not going to change with the bottom line being that they are still fairly consistent businesses okay and they are still going to be able to do it. And they have undergone a price correction already so and time correction already so it's not as if that you're buying it at a very expensive levels right so net net it's okay because otherwise what product will you think right so for example in my opinion something like PVR people will still be okay paying like high ticket prices because the customer segment is very elite okay similarly NRI oriented products the customer segment is very elite okay similarly dream folks which is into like lounge is etc so there their products and their cards etc works really well they are doing more partnership as the card business evolves now who really spends with like credit card debit cards a lot of like middle class people right I mean they do it so this business this segment of population has paying capacity okay so basically like target businesses where people have a paying capacity right so for example if I just have to quickly draw the grid right for example like a sugar industry right this is bad right here the only thing this is a complete cost based industry right if you can offer at the lowest possible price for example hal de ram is the buyer of Beltrampur Chini what does hal de ram care about price not the singular thing it creates about it doesn't give a shit about anything else okay sugar is sugar you're not going to change like quality much right on like unless like you have some very complicated manufacturing product then you had like companies like paid industries which was doing well but over long term you have to start thinking that okay can they premium eyes or not okay then at the top you will have like HUL Nestle okay has their business also gone now yes okay everyone's business has gone on it's not as if that you know what other companies are doing like exceptionally well okay but the point is that the hit is less because they can still premium eyes okay on top of this there will be like companies like dream folks PVR right which are catering to elite now again will their business get hit if the middle flash rings yes right because they're losing customers but the point is that they still don't have to discount their products they can still you know supply like provide like fixed seats okay so I hope that this kind of makes sense okay now let me take you through some other points okay now as long as you're not buying at you well expensive you would have still made a money in this sideways market okay that's what I keep on advocating and right now is a very good time to buy HUL why because it is below 200 day moving average line okay so this I'll teach tomorrow but right now it is at very good valuation okay same applies to Asian points demand in elastic now there are two types of demands Ravan is called as in elastic demand and another is called as elastic demand okay elastic demand means page industries okay so for example underwear goes from like 20% price hike you'll find something else okay because you don't care that much okay on the flip side insurance okay or hospitals right you have to get your kidney changed or whatever will you go to like sargharios will probably know right and you might go to like max only it lives with the Vaseline right but just save my life so that is a completely inelastic product okay now in India what are like two businesses that I'm betting on hospitals and insurance right massive crooks they are going to make crazy amount of money invest with them get rich okay so that's unfortunately what all you get okay so yeah so I'm no interest in selling like max stock and all that right it just bought it holding it they will compound wealth like anything okay so it's very simple even if you're buying them at a premium it's fine as long as you have 10 year viewpoint for example many of you think say that tell me like something in 10 years that I can buy hospitals okay so great stocks okay so just simply buy this chances of it as long as you're not buying them at an over valued price it's fine okay how to check over evaluation that we will talk tomorrow but generally strong business 100% yes why because the the business is very solid right now right why because the insurance industry is getting organized in India hardly handful of people had insurance before 2020 it will take at least 10 years for the insurance industry to get mature in India so insurance industry directly is going to benefit along with that what else is going to benefit hospitals because who home insurance industry style up with hospitals it becomes mandatory at one point okay so both of these things are great right I don't understand pharma I don't invest in pharma anymore okay could be both the right now right so in for example API or China so that India is all I'm not going to be right so not only in just by like insurance companies and stocks and hospital stocks for me that plays great right for you if you understand pharma industry which companies going to do which in drug launch be my guest like try to speculate on that I don't know enough about there is too many complications in that right because India is a very complicated supply chain right out of like even our API mark see API is I'm on API means those raw material through which medicines are built in pharma now we don't have an end product we don't have a brand brand person right
