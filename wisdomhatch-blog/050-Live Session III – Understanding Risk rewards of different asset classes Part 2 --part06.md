==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a candid, informal commentary on investment strategies, criticizing mutual funds and advocating for self-managed investing. The speaker emphasizes simplicity, common sense, and control over one's portfolio, highlighting examples like HDFC Bank’s resilience during market downturns. They discuss tax implications, the pitfalls of speculative stocks (e.g., HL), and the importance of hedging. Broader topics include real estate and data center investments, Bitcoin transfers, and living off investment income in tax-friendly jurisdictions like Dubai. The tone is blunt and opinionated, rejecting complex strategies in favor of fundamental principles like buying quality assets at reasonable prices.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Self-Managed Investing:** Retail investors should learn to manage their own money for better control and capital rotation.  
- **Critique of Mutual Funds:** Many fund managers underperform, even in bull markets, and high fees erode returns.  
- **Stick to Quality Stocks:** Focus on fundamentally strong companies (e.g., HDFC Bank) and avoid speculative bets (e.g., HL).  
- **Tax Efficiency:** Tax residency in low-tax countries (e.g., UAE, Singapore) can optimize returns; losses cannot be refunded but offset future gains.  
- **Market Timing:** Tops are identifiable through trends; maintaining hedges (e.g., 20% margin) is crucial during peaks.  
- **Living Off Investments:** A diversified portfolio of ~10 crores can sustain a comfortable lifestyle in low-tax, low-inflation regions like Dubai.  
- **Simplified Investing Philosophy:** "Buy good assets at reasonable prices"—avoid overcomplication.  
- **Avoid Unfamiliar Sectors:** Data centers and real estate are complex; only invest when commercialization or fundamentals are clear.  
- **Bitcoin Basics:** Use platforms like Polygon or WazirX for transactions; tutorials are available online.  
- **Negative Earnings:** Companies with losses lack a P/E ratio; focus on profitable growth stories.  

**Notable Quotes/Examples:**  
- "No one knows anything... even a bull market can destroy wealth."  
- "HDFC Bank’s 40% alpha saved portfolios during a 20% market crash."  
- "UAE’s 2% inflation vs. 6% returns allows 4% sustainable spending power."  
- "Value investing = good asset + reasonable price."

ORIGINAL TEXT:
e same thing yeah how can big mutual fund guys are very foolish because no one knows anything it's or a Mukherjee can destroy wealth in a bull market then I don't know what mutual fund or like you know money managers know I'm just being blunt with you right so a lot of people got pissed that I made a video on him and all that stuff right they talk of homes that's all I can say that's like you don't need to do any complex kind of strategies to make money in the stock market and retail investors should learn how to manage their own money I've been very vocal about this right because it gives you more control it allows you to rotate capital if nothing else right for example right now opportunity is there to buy it and 15% cheat why not buy it kind of this common sense few companies median P is always so high so see when company is you know is expected to post good growth rate consistently or if it's a monopoly company so to say its median P will be high okay are real estate mutual funds and real rates good for investment not at all yeah so I'll not touch rates okay entry exit example like HL today down can we add in cell later short term see like I mean you trade on good stocks you don't trade on bad stocks for a classic case studies HDFC bank for example I started buying HDFC bank two to a half three years ago I've not made any much money but honestly market went down 20% and HDFC in that phase run up by 20% so the alpha on HDFC bank was 20 40% in a way because it beat the market by 20% now if you look at it in an absolute tells you say here HDFC will go you wrote the new re but the point is that a portfolio what saved because of HDFC bank otherwise people are crying that they have like you know sort of lost 30% 40% of your portfolio and that allows you to survive in the market now if you survive the market for like a substantial period then automatically you will make money right so HL according to me is a bad stock known so therefore I don't touch it can people make 10x 20x maybe but I don't know a system to invest in it so I'll not touch it right there is no tax if you have booked profits and you can offset it entirely by doing tax laws harvesting right but government will not pay you for losses right they'll not refund your tax like and you'll have to adjust it in the next phase okay how can we transfer BTC to wallet right so there are tutorials on YouTube if you search you'll get okay can we ignore cash flow of assets real study job income for short term yes you can ignore okay why you are on the fence for data center themes I don't know enough about data centers like so I don't know like I'm saying real estate is a very complicated game in India right now data centers are of multiple types right thing that you need to run data centers is real estate right and real estate is expensive so it's like owning like a manufacturing unit so that's how I'll put it right how do we get absolute fee of a company so it's there no so like on a screener I showed you right so whatever the current trading fees and the dotted line right Kiran which which country you are in NRI in are you in so it also depends for example I'm a NRI but my tax residency is in UAE so therefore I pay zero tax if you are in UK US so for example you are in US so of course you'll have to pay tax right so why because these are high tax economies right so UAE is a high expense economy right so if you have the option right off taking a tax residency or if you're structuring a tax residency sensibly as a high-knit worth individual then it kind of makes sense to go to low tax economies right for example Singapore and UAE according to me are best countries to move to right from our tax residency perspective if you want to enjoy a quality of life go to Europe right because social structure is very strong all that stuff but you have to pay high tax right same applies to US that it's a high tax economy there is no difference between Indian taxation and US taxation okay yeah during parabolic who buys when both sells it says that trading volume goes down right so I mean no one is buying it right and because no one is buying it people keep on lowering the price at which see everything gets sold okay it's like you trying to sell a house if the fair value of your house is too crore but if it is a covid like situation and you need money emergency now in covid you can't even get like viewers for your house people are not going to come to your house and take a look you will try to remotely sell it now it's a guy I'm not like this in the room right so I'll only pay 50 lakhs and I'll know and I'm not right so what is happening is a distress sale okay so parabolic may be that there is distress sale of assets which is happening because no one is because everyone is selling and no one is buying right but you get a buyers at distress so when the price falls enough there will be buyers for example retail some H&I all that some new FIIs come some new DIA is come thereby right so all that's how do you know that top has come I don't know like so I mean top has come you can clearly see the top right so for example here you can clearly see the top this is the top right I mean this is what the thing is right so here you can see the top right this is top this was a market top this was a market top here it's important to be hedged right this is a market top right so all these are tops right at the top you should at least have like 20% margins okay so you should always your portfolio should always have the ability to 120% for me okay why do hold shop protesting with this I have answered semiconductor index I'm buying guys but the only issue that I see in the US market is that the valuation is still very very high right on things so ideally you should go in sideways correction right which means that you have to invest slowly and build your portfolio over the next one to two years that's what I'm my current hypothesis is now if tomorrow market corrects by like another 20% the weight happened in 2021 that entire NASDAQ corrected by 30% now that's a bulk by opportunity right I mean not crazy levels right they begin a more sensible question here would be that you what okay so a more sensible question here would be that if you invest 70% tomorrow and if a 20% correction happens on the market what will you do now you'll say that okay I have 30 more percent of money which I can deploy then great do it right but if it should not happen that you invest 70% tomorrow and the market corrects by another 20% and you don't have any money right so that should not yeah value investing is now restricted there is honestly like value investing growth investing momentum in the sub-bicarbonate right the simple point is buy good asset at reasonable enough price right by doing moda moda map right that's what I'm trying to teach you okay your views on space industry it is not commercial yet so when it gets commercialized that's when it becomes palatable for retail investors how do I Bitcoin and India well polygo vazar because you can buy there okay codec is very high in price but if I look at the current p2 it's discounted can I enter yes because price does not matter price to it price to earning matters right it's again saying like you know my salary is like 50 grotes now yes it's 50 grotes but in what context of the skill and the value that you're adding to your company so that's a better question to ask no that okay I'm adding like 100 grotes of value to my company therefore I'm commanding a salary of 50 grotes then it's lying right but if you just look at the absolute number 50 grotes you'll feel that you know it's like very high right sorry minimum amount of money to move to Dubai or any part of UA after 10 years relying only on world stock market for living okay that's interesting because that is precisely what I'm also doing okay so for example like if you have to live off and let's say good life in Dubai I would say that you're like good life I would say is like if you are willing to live in charge in a slash a jiman then I think you can live a very good life very big apartment all that stuff in 50 60 lakhs a year okay so that's the corpus that you need 50 60 lakhs a year where you don't have to think like you know before doing like some activity and all that right I mean you know you can go out eat well travel whenever you feel like take taxis whatever and you don't have to look at prices before buying stuff so if you can survive one of 50 CR or sorry 50 lakh a year kind of an expense you've been designed life right now okay so to make 50 lakhs or withdraw 50 lakhs then again run the math that how big your portfolio should be right so withdrawable amount should be like in context of that right so then it depends on what is the portfolio size so let's assume like 10 cross okay so if the portfolio size is 10 cross and you're not going to work right then can you grow that portfolio at let's say 6% in UA so the answer is yes you can do it okay that's not a problem 2% is the inflation in UA right so that gives you 4% spending power so which is 40 lakhs on a 10 crore portfolio so if you have 10 crores and if you want to live off of investment income with no new income coming in then I think with 10 12 crores we can plan at a time okay why do prominent mutual funds okay this I've answered video please explain how and when to diversify but see I mean the mathematics changes right I mean if you're an earnings so you don't require like 10 crore corpus okay so but I feel that I mean if you know how to manage your money if you're not paying crazy taxes if you're living sensibly then 10 crore portfolio in UA you can plan a life right so the PESL explain more what might be the reason P.I doesn't have a P on screen because the earnings are negative right so price to earning means that earning should be positive earning means how much profits you're making so if it's a loss making company it will not have an E o
