==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text is a transcript of a discussion covering various investment topics, including real estate scouting, community access, stock indices in China, Bitcoin transactions in India, real estate in Pune, tax loss harvesting, international real estate in Dubai, investment in multiplex stocks (PVR/INOX), government-backed insurance products (ULIPs), and handling spare funds. The speaker emphasizes learning from mistakes, focusing on high-yield investments, avoiding government-backed schemes, and relying on expert analysis rather than personal stock research.

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. **Real Estate Investment**: Requires extensive scouting and experience; mistakes are part of the learning process. Focus on high-demand metro areas (e.g., Pune) where prices rarely fall, but ensure the yield (rental income) justifies the investment.  
2. **Stock Indices in China**: Prefer indices like Hang Seng and iShares China Large-Cap ETF over individual stocks for safer exposure.  
3. **Bitcoin in India**: P2P transactions (e.g., in Delhi’s Palika Bazaar) operate in a legal gray area; caution is advised.  
4. **International Real Estate (Dubai)**: Requires significant capital (>₹1.8 crore) and cash purchases, as loans are unlikely for Indian residents without credit history.  
5. **Multiplex Stocks (PVR/INOX)**: Monopoly in the luxury segment; revenue stability matters more than short-term negative EPS. Trust expert analysis over personal research.  
6. **Government-Backed Insurance (ULIPs)**: Strongly discouraged due to inefficiency, high commissions, and low growth. Existing policies may need reevaluation.  
7. **Tax Loss Harvesting**: No strict waiting period—can repurchase stocks the next day after selling.  
8. **Spare Funds**: Avoid deploying funds impulsively (e.g., in OD loans) without a clear investment strategy. Prioritize high-growth avenues over low-yield options.  

### Additional Notes:  
- **Community Access**: Temporary (e.g., 1 year) is sufficient to gain independence; rejoin if value persists.  
- **Expertise vs. DIY**: For complex topics (taxation, stock analysis), rely on specialists rather than personal judgment.  
- **Risk Awareness**: Emphasizes avoiding "gray area" investments and government inefficiencies.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
I keep on looking right and out of like one thousand properties I'll scout I'll find one viable okay so which will meet my criteria right so it's it's a long process managed it will come with experience so it's not just like 60 40 or something of that it's about more money you invest in something the more clarity you'll get right so initially when I bought properties I made a lot of mistakes so I don't want you guys to make it so I don't want to give like premature at least it's yeah and one thing regarding community so how much till how much time you can access the community is that uh one year suppose that I don't know like I mean you're on your own it's a if you go on can can we pay for it in the community access yeah I haven't thought like I mean honestly one year at a time is more than enough right um honestly like uh but like after that you will be in good shape to do it on your own but if you see value then you just join again or something right so that's okay thanks a lot good okay content yeah yeah yeah yeah actually so related to this community anyways after one year we can again join the youtube community right so that's there I mean why you worry about like after one year one year maybe one year after I'll stop like you know stock investing only like who knows like I mean one year I don't think that would happen okay so so my my first question is on China so for for China we should just play on indices right no individual stock investing and can you you mentioned I think three indices to hang sing uh and two others I missed can you just mention those one was there on my excel spread sheet so I'll send that to you okay okay third was large cap ETF so it was I share China large cap ETF okay okay that's true investor yeah it should be there on west sure uh then uh another question is on hard wallet you said that we can get it on amazon and during the sessions you happen to mention that in Delhi in Palika bazaar you can go and transfer Bitcoin but is that even legal in India or anything that is not legal is is anything that is not illegal is legal it's so I don't know if any rule that prevents people from going to Palika bazaar and doing P2P investing on Bitcoin so yeah that's what the definition of legality is let's say in like India a lot of things are gray area right so this is gray area yeah okay uh then I know that you always say that buying real estate in metrosities you are not really very far from I'm from Pune and uh we have seen that typically in the core city areas the property rates never fall it's just a demand supply because Pune is I mean a lot of people migrate to Pune so the property is always in demand so if we know or if we have a confidence that uh the the demand would continue then we can still go and buy safe flats in those areas so that you know see property prices do not fall anywhere right I mean it's very rare locations are there where property prices fall the question is always about property price appreciation and the yield now if the yield makes sense for example if you buy a one crore property in Pune means that you whatever right and today you can buy it at one crore and today you can rent it at four lakhs that flat it's fine it's not a problem right but if you are finding such deals great my hypothesis is that you will not find it that's the problem okay uh and my last question is on tax law harvesting so uh for tax law harvesting is there any duration I mean between which you have to I mean once you sell can you immediately buy or you have to buy next day because then yeah buy next day okay sure I think that's it and thanks a lot for my next question thank you thank you okay uh solution yes actually thank for the session so I had two questions on this on this understood stocks uh a taxing uh it's same as the listed stocks in India or when we sell leafy wise by something from internet I don't see it gets listed when we sell it what how's the access to that uh please double check it you're asking me see a level questions guys so when you know as sometimes I might misspeak on this so this is like I'm a broad guy right I'm not like I don't uh I don't have an expertise in finance in in taxation right so I have an expertise in finance central okay so just take just read it on and credit just check with their team so they will be able to give you correct information on this okay I got one more question uh for this by real estate if you don't have a credit history in the why will the banks use loans no uh 99% of the times they will not you need to be a cash buyer right and it kind of makes sense to be a cash buyer the reason is that and you should only get into the why real estate or international real estate as an Indian if you have money to finance that entire property what is the minimum ticket size I would say 800,000 dirams which is approximately 1.8 CR so if you have 1.8 CR to invest then only touch the why properties as of today as an Indian tax resident if you're a Dubai tax resident it's a different story okay thank you all yeah Ankita hi actually my question is around multi-vacals so I was just applying all those your teachings on pvr i-nox so I see that it was a good but the it was is beyonding per earning per share it's in negative so the only so we invest in this talk with this speculation that people will not stop watching movies is that it no so people haven't stopped watching movies therefore their revenues are still 6.5 thousand crore they are monopoly there is no other comparator to pvr i-nox tell me a comparator to be where i-nox okay it's a luxury segment rich people only can afford to watch movies now right i mean those old days are over when you know like average people used to go to movie theaters it's only rich people game that you go park your car at 100 rupees an hour crap right so like when you're paying like 100 rupees for walking then you're going eating 500 rupees popcorn and then you're buying like a movie ticket of 350 so it's like rich people's game the rich people's facility right so when it's okay so from that angle so as long as you are generating revenues they will figure out a way to make profit from rich people okay but now you have told me that pvr is a very good stock but how do we figure it out you don't need to that's the point right i mean your job is not stock analysis your job is intelligent consumption of investment information right so otherwise you'll go mad right i mean this is not your profession it's like not it's like saying that he tell me how to create like statistics okay so now that's a job of a statistician that they will present data in front of you you have to absorb it got it what it okay thank you so much cool all right uh Sandra Ravi first thing uh actually thanks a lot really appreciate the session uh and my question is that few years back the insurance product were not taxed on maturity in india but i think over three years back the government changed its rule but there was a lot of view for you in the market you know and a lot of stats were being presented and uh kind of given that i'm not a very financially knowledgeable person didn't want to kind of lose that right so as a part of diversification i invested in u-lips okay so i have paid i think around three or four installments are paid and around two three are remaining so what do you think should i re-well then just your your take see government money is scam money okay so the more you invest in government money the more easy you make it for them the less money you will make okay government is one of the most inefficient organizations out there in anything okay if you ask me to build go a tourism i can make it better than thailand not kidding okay in a year's time okay why because i have now's inside i can do it i can practically you know apply those things but no one will take my view if you ask government to handle money they are dead weight okay so like a monkey can invest money better than government okay so on that right so the moment you start trusting the government that they will take your money invest through l i c and all that stuff the moment the number one rule of investing is do not give money to government okay as long as you're doing that you are already taking a loss okay of inefficiency so that's how it goes so don't invest in u-lips you will is so bad right so but this one do it so this was like private i c s here signature i mean see it's pension fund right so pension fund you deploy for retirement planning correct and yes and from that angle it's a very low growth product so it doesn't make sense why you do touch it if you're doing it via l i c an insurance product you'll have then it's pure government right so i mean don't do that as well i had done few two i c s here and few two s d f c so just don't know it even hdfc i c i c i banking products don't buy because they will charge you a very high commissions and there is honestly no alpha on those products from a growth perspective so these are not growth at all the only thing banks are good for are banking service credit debit cards because you have no other option b-fds from time to time that's it okay there is no other product you should buy from a bank you think i should re-ball with them after paying around half of the installments and maybe if it is not making sense or stick with it to be honest like i mean i cannot help you rectify the problem if you have bought it wrong right so it's a tough conversation for me to have but i generally would advise people not to enter there right i mean now you have entered now you have to do the revaluation right i mean then a lot more complications come in i would generally not advise you to enter wrongly like honestly i don't have like you know good anything good to say right or there okay yeah yeah hi action so just i want advice from your side so i have around 35 lakhs of money spare money in terms of the it's a OD loan kind of okay so right n
