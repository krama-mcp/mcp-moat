SUMMARY:
**  
The transcript is from a live session discussing US stock investing (Part 2), covering topics like gold accumulation (physical vs. digital), real estate investment strategies (focusing on yield and location), and the advantages of international investing—particularly in US tech stocks (NASDAQ). The speaker emphasizes the shift from a factory-based economy to internet-driven businesses (e.g., AI, semiconductors, CRISPR) and argues for long-term bets on US tech due to its growth potential. They also touch on challenges in Indian tech adoption and regulatory hurdles for crypto/Web3 projects, citing examples of Indian founders relocating to Dubai for better opportunities.  

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Gold Investment**: Treat gold as a "rainy day fund"; physical gold (e.g., certified bars) is preferable for buy-and-hold purposes, not as a trading asset.  
- **Real Estate**: Focus on properties yielding at least 4% to be viable; leverage loans strategically (e.g., a 7.5% yield property with a 5% loan rate generates free cash flow). Malaysia is highlighted as a foreigner-friendly land-buying destination.  
- **US Tech Dominance**: NASDAQ’s outperformance (181% vs. Nifty’s 113% over 5–7 years) reflects the shift to "Internet 2.0" (AI, robotics, gene editing). The speaker advocates heavy allocation (60–70%) to US stocks for long-term growth.  
- **Currency Impact**: INR’s depreciation (~4% annually) further amplifies USD-denominated returns from US investments.  
- **Indian Tech Limitations**: While India has strong developers, consumer adoption and regulatory barriers (e.g., crypto/Web3) hinder local innovation, pushing founders to relocate (e.g., Dubai for tax/legal benefits).  
- **Startup Realities**: Even high-profile startups (e.g., WazirX) face operational challenges, but backing by top investors (e.g., Peter Thiel) signals credibility despite risks.  
- **Actionable Advice**: Compare indices (NASDAQ vs. Nifty), prioritize yield-generating assets, and explore international diversification for structural growth opportunities.

==================================================

 Okay guys, alright, so I'm back. You have a minute to go. What is the best way to accumulate gold? Physical or digital? Right? See, you talk to your local jeweler, you buy it at 10 gram gold. You can also buy certified gold, but the price is a little bit higher. Right? Is it worth it? See, I mean, if the idea is to just buy and hold, then it's fine. It's not like really like, see, it's a rainy day fund. So that's what I would say. So just treat it that way. It's not a TTF, it does not make any sense. Gold TTF for 11th benchmark to compare is an FT50, not gold. Okay, so with my sound weird, because both is government money at the end of the day. Yes, Hush. Wait, wait, yeah. Hush, uh, hi. You've been, hello. Yes, yes. Yeah, I've been talking about building real estate portfolio as well. And I have been sort of doing that with apartments at the moment. One in Jaipur and one in Mumbai, but in the past few years, what I realized is that all my apartments have just paid the usual, you know, 10 to 15% of down payment and rest is all loaned. And two things which I feel is that most of the time the amount to be paid back takes a large chunk of what you feel like, you know, you can invest in some other asset like equal to reason, you know, it can be good to run up. So I'm always confused what should be done. That's because you did not buy a high quality property. Okay, so that's the problem. So if a property is not generating 4% yield to begin with, it's not a viable asset. So if you buy wrong, then no one can help. So that's a simple baseline and that's what I would say. Okay, Sandeep, just write to me separately. I'll connect you with a relevant person on this not an issue. I feel right and especially like in terms of land buying, right? I feel Malaysia is really good. So if you're looking to buy land and in a foreign land, in a foreign country, Malaysia allows it. I'm studying more. There was someone from Malaysia who was on this class. I would love to get in touch, right? And I would, I'm also trying to build more understanding. I'll buy something next in Malaysia as well. Okay, so it's one of the very few countries that allows foreigners to own land, which is absolutely amazing. Taking loan and buying real estate makes sense. Absolutely yes. It depends on what type of property you're buying just to tell you the math. I'm making net 7.5% yield on the Dubai property that I own. If I were to take a loan against it, I would have to pay a 5%. So basically I can finance 80% of my property for free. Did you get it? I can make money out of it. So like 2.5% yield, right? So, usually find the leader of college and so on, much insiders of the MZR and quite an eliminate point. Okay, that's good. Okay, guys. So now comes the question of international investing, right? I will try to be quick and give you like an introduction, a sensible introduction on this topic where you can start, at least start your investing journey. Okay. First and foremost, tell you the concept of US, denominate, denominated returns. Okay. So for example, if you are the first key concept that you need to know is that you go here, right? And you look at nifty 50. Okay. So you go here and you type nifty 50 index. Close this. Right. He goes this. Right. You click on this tab and you compare it to you queue, queue, which is NASA DAC. Okay. So the moment you click this, your eyes will go wide open. Okay. So why? Because QQ has given 181.72% return and nifty has given 113% return. Okay. In the last six, seven years. Okay. Now, let's go back. Okay. So for example, if we look at any time frame, any time frame, right? So from this time to this time, you will consistently see that this blue chart, a purple chart is above this. Okay. The point I'm trying to tell you is that if we try to uncover this reason that, okay, why is NASA DAC, which is a US based index, is growing so fast. It's very simple. Okay. And this return is in US dollar returns. And this return is in INR terms. They haven't adjusted for that parity also. So if you adjusted for that, that in our five year period, INR has fallen by at least 4% per year or five years, 20%. So you add another 20% here. Okay. So this is the adjusted comparable return between NASDAQ and INR. I'm sorry, NASDAQ and nifty 50. Okay. Now, two questions come up that, okay, one you spoke about INR falling. Why do I bother? Because I am in India. Number two is, why is it that NASDAQ is giving so much returns? Well, it's very simple. And it's a long term structural bit. Okay. 3,000, 2000 was a pivotal year. Okay. Before 2000, the business world used to be on a factory model. Okay. There was no very less internet based application or consumer applications based on internet. We used to, everything used to be factory driven. This was like, you know, intelligent investor type of books were returned for these type of businesses that Ford will put like 10 assembly lines, then they will put 20, then they will put 40, then they will keep on expanding and they will build a mood and they will ensure efficiency and they will deliver a good. Okay. Post 2000 companies like Amazon, Netflix, etc, etc. Okay. Okay. Now, they ran the first version of the internet. And now in 2025, we are on the version 2.0 2025 is a massive pivotal year. Now, what type of new M7s will be created? Well, I would argue that AI stocks, semiconductor stocks, computational power, right. You have robotics. You have CRISPR technology. CRISPR technology means gene editing, right. You have robots, arjories. Okay. You have automation at scale, right. You have drone deliveries. You have self-driving autonomous cars. This is version 2.0 of the internet. Okay. Now, what will drive this adoption forward? Like what? Like I mean, do you think nifty 50 will drive this adoption forward on NASDAQ? It will be NASDAQ. Okay. So even if you close your eyes and invest like at whatever levels on NASDAQ and if this theory turns out right that in the next 25 years or the next 15 20 years, so then buy and forget, buy and forget. Now, to buy and forget, then NASDAQ will be done. That's the only asset class worth buying and forgetting. Okay. Why? Because this is a tech index. Is it right to compare an FT 100% right what else will you compare it with? Right. It's a US index, right. So it's a market index. There are two indices, SMP 500 and NASDAQ. So I'll compare it to SMP 500 also. Okay. India does not have a tech tech index. Okay. India is an IT index. It's called an FPI T. Okay. So in the bottom line being that if the nature of the business itself is changing from factory model to internet 1.0 where Netflix, Google, Meta, etc. came up became mature become multi-trillion dollar companies. Now we are in version 2.0 of the internet. Next 10 15 years, it's a no brainer that version 2.0 companies for the internet are going to dominate. Okay. What am I doing? I will be putting almost 60 70% of my bets on US stocks. Okay. That's it. I had meticulously worked for the last one and a half to years to get myself into a position where I can actually build a big portfolio on this now. Right. What I serve you. Whatever. Right. So but the point is that even if I look at it from a secular growth perspective, this is where adoption is happening. Okay. Now you'll say that. Okay. I mean, and all that stuff. Yes. I'm not saying that India may be in India. It will be second layer adoption. Right. Very similar to how it happened for it that who are the primary buyers of it products like US Europe, right. Almost 65 70% of business for TCS emphasis comes from US Europe. Okay. Something similar will happen that you know, for example, if some variant of AI, for example, India is a very big developer community. Indian developers are really smart. If you speak with them on blockchain web 3.0, I'm well connected and like go up blockchain network. So we are trying to build like crypto adoption and go like so with a couple of startups are working. I have made investments in them. So I get to learn a lot right from these developers right to understand their viewpoint. So when it comes to developers or tech developers in India, very strong smart community. When it comes to consumers in India, they are they have no clue what is happening. Okay. So why because commercial applications Indian companies are not going to develop. Because commercial applications are built due to regulatory support. Okay. Now what do I mean by that? For example, if let's pick like crypto currencies, right. So for example, web 3.0 projects, right. This might look like Greek alien and you know, do people who are like who are not interested in tech, but I'll just conclude it in like maybe two minutes. But for example, if you consider like top crypto founders from India, okay. For example, Somad Kupptai is a good friend of mine. I mean, he runs coin DCX. It has raised like 250 million dollars. It is a three-challenge. First one was the reason Dubai. He has moved to Dubai. Okay. Vazir X guy. I don't know him. He has moved to Dubai. Okay. Mathik, which is an India based blockchain network. And our team has moved to Dubai. Now what is our fascination with Dubai? Yeah. Tax free, but it's also legitimacy of building things. Okay. World Vazir X gone nowhere. No. So see guys, I mean, honestly, it's very easy to make fun of like Vazir X, if we could have to exchange hacking over a world to all that stuff. It's start up investing. Now world was invested by Peter Thiel. Now Peter Thiel is not some food to investor, right. Peter Thiel Foundation is very big. They invest after proper due diligence. So if you put like 28% entry to X, 28% exit to X, 28% operational tags or whatever, and if nothing is left, then of course, there are, and if you freeze the bank account, what do you think is going to happen w
