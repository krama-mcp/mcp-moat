SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses various investment strategies, focusing on real estate, gold, and international diversification. It highlights the importance of real estate in high-inflation economies like India due to rising population and rental demand, contrasting it with shrinking populations in Europe (e.g., UK). The speaker advises against owning property in the UK due to high taxes and declining rents, recommending UAE and India instead. Other topics include converting mutual funds to direct plans, tax-efficient investing in Malaysia/UAE, and avoiding Bitcoin purchases through Indian exchanges due to high taxes. The speaker also touches on portfolio building, USD holdings, and emergency funds.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Real Estate in India vs. UK:**  
  - India’s rising population makes real estate a bullish play, while Europe’s shrinking population reduces rental demand.  
  - UAE (e.g., Dubai, Sharjah) and India are preferred due to strategic growth and tax efficiency.  

- **Inflation Hedge:**  
  - Real estate is critical in high-inflation economies (e.g., India) as construction costs and rents rise.  
  - Gold is less practical for immediate housing needs during inflation.  

- **Tax Efficiency:**  
  - Malaysia and UAE are recommended for low-tax living/investing.  
  - UK’s high taxes and property taxes make renting preferable to owning.  

- **Diversification:**  
  - Liquid assets (e.g., USD) are prioritized over illiquid real estate in portfolios.  
  - Avoid Bitcoin purchases via Indian exchanges due to tax inefficiency; use ETFs instead.  

- **Practical Advice:**  
  - Convert mutual fund regular plans to direct plans to cut costs.  
  - Emergency funds should be kept in top-tier banks without over-optimizing returns.  
  - Foreign investment limits (e.g., India’s LRS scheme: ~₹2 crore/year) must be considered.  

- **Market-Specific Insights:**  
  - Japan’s low-inflation policy limits nominal returns.  
  - Australia’s currency stability and tax regime are uncertain.  
  - China’s Hang Seng Index ETF is a viable investment route for Indian investors.  

- **Tenancy Laws:**  
  - India’s weak tenancy laws exacerbate housing instability during hyperinflation, unlike UAE’s regulated rent increases.  

- **Portfolio Building:**  
  - Focus on liquid assets first, then allocate to real estate strategically.  
  - For NRIs, consider US/UAE/Malaysia markets for zero or low capital gains taxes.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
e problem is that gold serves a different purpose real estate serves a different purpose if India ends up like a fraction of what happened in Pakistan Sri Lanka Venezuela we go through that inflation problem can you live in your gold no you can still like you will still have to own like real estate problem with real estate is that see construction of the real estate takes time so like in that two three year period when you're struggling for housing because your owner and in India problem is that the tenancy laws are absolute pathetic right for example like in certain countries UA charge like and all that Emirates there is a very specific tenancy law that you can't increase if you're if you're renting from someone the house owner cannot increase rent for three years in charge okay similarly there isn't rira index in you in Dubai right according to that only you can increase rent it's not as if you do manmarziya karadowana bhagjawakal right and all that stuff so whenever hyper inflation problem happens this is housing is the first thing that gets you messed up right so to control your cost of living in a country like India which is expected to face high inflation having some exposure to direct real estate kind of makes sense okay the cost of construction will not go up crazily right I mean even if you own a land and if you're as you're part of it to be it's fine right but at least one summer real estate right at some stage right after once here okay I'll I'll give you an understanding of my portfolio so you have a separate portfolio building class I'll bring that okay I'm new investor I'm spending options on days and working you away okay I will be sure let me try like what advice do you want I mean how you let me okay did not understand why real growth is deflictionary okay so for example I'm sure that you know of what is the meaning of PE ratio right surprise to earnings okay now similarly if you look at it from an economy point of view real GDP what does it do it increases the earning of the economy right so the earning is the denominator so if the economy itself look trizy but the earnings go up of the economy due to real productivity therefore the PE ratio will come down right so therefore it is deflictionary in nature right how to invest in other countries okay so you were you were investing we have a class right so I will help you understand same kind of principles apply in US right so I will cover this right in that session right US DT I would not hold right it's better to own like US dollar directly if you can right in India you can't hold foreign currency unless through NRE account right so yeah how to create a two-crore portfolio so someone having zero exposure to how to create a portfolio someone having zero exposure to how to create okay so portfolio building we have a class I'll answer it mathletes have answered this question that you just simply cut and move to direct there is no point in paying unnecessary expenses I like the point of controlling how to create a question and I'm so right time to buy a property by living long term in which phase of your life but let's say specific income level should you focus on real estate whether let's say living in if living in UK see I would not advise you to own a property in UK now you might disagree with me but here is the argument right the population of India is rising right and it will continue to rise till 2065 so real estate is a bullish play in India but when it comes to Europe the population of Europe is shrinking because it's a Egypt population to start with now of course there will be pockets like central London all that it has like limited supply and whatnot but generally the rains in India will go up because the population is increasing and generally right on a base case scenario the rents in UK should come down right because the population is shrinking a classic case studies in the middle which is UAE right that UAE cost of living is typically high right and they are trying to increase their population base and UAE government is one of the most efficient governments in the world right they are very strategic right and they will increase their population base so it kind of makes sense to own properties in like regions like UAE India right because of the expectation of population increase now UK I can't understand like the reason to own a house I would rather rent right and also the property taxes in UK as far as I know are high so like that's another problem right I'm thinking of getting real estate out of my current portfolio in India plus US is still not should I get real estate or not no you should first build liquid real estate okay so that's okay content about teaching investments to kid absolutely service area okay I'll try okay good real estate opportunities in Bangalore China you simply buy a fund right so I mean Hansang index it's already listed on India if you go on kite by zero or something and if you if you search Hansang index and there's a video also that I've done on this topic how to invest in China it's a public video so you guys can watch it not a problem those living in UK what should we do those living in UK diversify out of UK that's literally step one okay so so many people are moving from UK to UAE because of high taxation in UK right so it's very important that you move to like a low cost of taxation economy right Malaysia UAE are my two topics if I have to like pick like two countries which are tax efficient and kind of makes sense to live there it will be Malaysia and UAE now UAE people primarily have complaints than the cost of living is very high but honestly cost of living in Dubai is very high but if you move to like Emirates like Ajman or if you move to Emirates like Sharjah etc the cost of living gets dramatically cut because your rents get dramatically cut right now that's not an option that everyone would have but like that's like an option that some of you can explore okay how do I transfer India funds to Dubai now it depends on your resident status right so for example if you are a tax resident of India then you have to do it via what do you call liberalize LRS scheme right so you can add the most transfer approximately two crores out of India every year legally okay if you're in NRO that that means that you are a tax resident of some other country then you can move up to a million dollars from India to abroad yes so I'm holding for you guys when we purchase unlisted it's at like it went to six hundred now it's back to one listed price right so but it's a good consumption play I'm not I I doesn't make sense to like you know sort of it doesn't make sense to sell it okay okay to invest in enhancing index yes yes it's it's a good index you can even buy it it just started to give break out it is up like thirty thirty five percent right no so if for people living in UAE the capital gains tax from Indian stocks is twelve point five okay and out of one ninety six countries India is the only country in the world which imposes capital gains tax on for FIs or foreign investors not FIs foreign if you do this again in US the capital gains for you is zero okay so this was one of the complaints that you know people have like sort of pushing and yeah like in Suntani and like I got a little bit more tool trade case this has been changed yeah you need to be from goa to buy probably no nothing like that I'm not from goa multiple properties here in fact my biggest portfolio is in goa arrested market okay where to keep keep emergency fund evd's nothing nothing complicated to be done and evd's with top tier banks and forget about like you know g1 is giving this much and you know for an IDFC is giving me this much and all that just keep it at top tier banks okay estimate how do we estimate what a real estate on percentage of home loans that you have paid so for example if you have you took a five ten year loan and five you own five where you have paid so one could and there's a very high probability that you will be able to pay the rest of the loans also then you consider 50% value of it okay mutual fund regular to direct yes you can convert no problem a ud currency deposit into usd okay that's interesting I have not studied Australian dollars yes so not sure but is it is Australia not like stable currency right I mean is it like going down and not sure I'll study it it's not that complex but Australia is definitely high tax as far as I know but like from a currency wise I'm not sure right okay um Rajesh I cannot do this for the Indian community right I do have an NRI community right which is separately run I do it on that okay staying in Malaysia should I invest in India or US and Malaysia stock market keeping in mind zero taxation outside India so you should invest primarily in US UA Malaysia good thing about Malaysia is that basically it's a very good turn around economy right now right and like I mean having for example buying land Malaysia is kind of makes a lot of sense right so you know I am looking into it right so I don't like Malaysia that must be honest like from a living point of view I like Thailand more but if I were in Malaysia I had comfort in Malaysia I would have bought a land there because there are very few foreign countries in the world that allows foreigners to own land in their country and Malaysia as well which is really good right so investing in Bitcoin or only through West India see buy Bitcoin ETF if you can't buy Bitcoin don't buy it through Indian exchange like coin DCX and all that because then what ends up happening is that you have to liquidate it before transferring it anywhere and then you're subjected to very high taxation right I'll talk Japan Japan is not really an investible market right for multiple reasons because they don't want to increase inflation in their economy so you never end up getting like very high absolute or nominal returns right so not absolute written nominal returns is not
