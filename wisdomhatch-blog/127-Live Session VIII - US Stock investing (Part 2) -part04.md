==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text discusses investment strategies in the US market, particularly focusing on the current bearish phase (2025 in the context provided) as an opportune time to build long-term positions. The speaker argues that major indices like NASDAQ and S&P 500, along with individual stocks (e.g., Google, Amazon, Microsoft), are at attractive discounts (15–25% corrections) and recommends staggered investing (e.g., 25–33% allocations initially). Historical data (75 years) is cited to highlight the rarity of such declines (once every 3–6 years) and the high probability of bullish recoveries. Sector-specific ETFs (e.g., semiconductors, AI, cloud computing) are also suggested for diversification. The speaker emphasizes patience, mathematical odds, and avoiding short-term panic despite potential further short-term declines.

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Current market conditions**: NASDAQ and S&P 500 are at ~15% discounts, with individual stocks (Google, Amazon, Microsoft) down 20–25%—presenting a favorable entry point for long-term investors.  
- **Staggered investing**: Start with 25–33% positions in downward markets, reserving subsequent allocations for deeper corrections or trend reversals.  
- **Historical precedent**: Over 75 years, US markets were bullish 58 years (77% of the time); current bearish phases (like 2025) are rare (once every 3–6 years for 15%+ declines).  
- **Sectoral opportunities**: ETFs targeting high-growth sectors (semiconductors [SOXX], AI [XLK], cybersecurity, clean energy) offer diversification beyond broad indices.  
- **Patience is key**: Short-term losses are likely, but historical data supports strong 3–4 year recovery odds. Avoid panic-selling during volatility.  
- **Regulatory note**: The speaker separates US and Indian stock discussions due to compliance constraints, focusing on US investments in their community.  
- **TCS consideration**: Tax Collected at Source (TCS) on foreign investments is mentioned but deemed unavoidable for January transactions.  
- **Technical indicators**: Death cross patterns (bearish signals) may suggest further declines, but these are opportunities for bulk buying.  
- **Portfolio strategy**: For diversification, allocate 40% to broad indices (S&P 500/NASDAQ) and 60% to narrow sectoral ETFs (e.g., robotics, cloud computing).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ppened so is this a good time to buy yes what are you buying your buying roughly a from top you're buying roughly a 14 15% price correction right and almost a year of time correction okay so this is not a so I will not say that this is like you know over value I will not say that you know this is like undervalued but is it a good time to start building your positions yes so first 25% positions that you will build you can do it blindly okay as long as you are buying in a downward market okay the next 25 so I thought you're going to be like final 25 you have to apply the most brain okay so but as of now great time to enter NASDAQ if you look at it at an individual stock level so for example if you go and study Google I mean we have spoken about it so here what you will notice is that again a channel breakdown has happened on Google right I have already drawn this channel for you if you study how much it has fallen from its peak right it has fallen roughly 25 26% from its peak so is it a good time to buy Google tomorrow yes okay very good time okay what about Amazon okay so at least your first bulk buy should happen okay we can it fall by another 10% yeah suppose it can't right but will you lose money in the long term very unlikely okay what about this again a channel break down has happened right so for example if you consider Amazon right so I'm happy again 25 26% downtrend has already happened right same applies to Microsoft so all big big good companies are all in by more than 20 25% now it's a guy you know you know but I very share on it with you to do that and all that stuff right so many so get the part of it so yes let us understand okay that what actually meta data tells us about US investing okay so here is like a data that my team has compiled right and what you will see is that if you study the last 75 years of US investing history okay 58 years have been bullish years 16 or 21 percent of the times the market has been bearish okay so in 20 25 is this a bullish year or a bearish year for US stocks bearish okay which means what that this is a buyer okay this probably might be sell else okay you get fewer opportunities to buy US stocks okay so this is like the reason why that even if it looks overvalued by it okay buy a little bit okay now animal percentage gain or loss so for example if we are looking to buy like in which zone are we we are already in this zone okay because what is Nasdaq telling us that it is almost at 15% discount okay we are here so there is only a 5.4% probability that Nasdaq falls or like the index falls by around 15% if it falls more great awesome right now if it falls by 40% even amazing okay but we are already buying in a very good zone okay so everyone understands okay so what am I going to do I am going to do 33% of my investment now will I be at a loss most likely yes in the short term only but on a 3 4 year basis right I am most likely mathematically speaking studying the 75 year history I will be okay okay every hundred me okay 20 25 is a great time to build your portfolio is right so I mean that's what I would say now S&P 500 right I mean for example if you take this that for example what is the size of the decline so we are in 15% or more zone this happens only once every 3 years okay so this again is very solid this is important 20% or more right for example if you buy it today I don't know what you buy it like 100 okay and it falls by another 5% so then from the top get the idea 20% discount your portfolio will be at 95k now some people will start creating Rakhas Kya Rakhs Riyal Khadil Yadar right and you know what like a nook Sanu we have 5,000 US dollars cut this that so but by please see this happens once every 6 years only okay so it's not as if that you know you bought like something bad just have patience have show patience for 2 3 years this will give you very good games okay so this is another very important point okay now if we look at air wise right that Y2D YTD it's a yield till here okay yielded air till date okay so you will see that half for example that typical like air wise a gram Jai so it can have you nook San you that's usually like the anticipated thing is that by the year recovery will happen right on whatever you are buying now so therefore like my estimate is that this year itself I will invest like close to like $6,000 to $7,000 my ideas to put like $2 million over the next 1 to 2 years okay maybe even $3 million right depends right on a lot of things but yeah the idea is to have like a 3 4 million dollar portfolio in the US first 1 million dollar I want to build fast so I'm doing it this year because of this metadata which I have spent a lot of time creating for you guys okay so hopefully this kind of makes sense okay now you would say that okay fine right what can we buy first right so I would advise you to either consider broad market or narrow tech market okay now broad market means what broad market means S&P 500 okay now you go here and you look at S&P okay so this is called as Spx okay so here you will see right now if you and get to buy this is this a bulk by zone for me yes I'll at least have 35 40% of my position in this zone right now okay so like I mean if I get to buy this okay everyone with me okay why because I showed you the metadata okay so I showed you the metadata and if you consider this fall this is like a 14 15% fall on the broad index this rarely happens okay so therefore this is like good time right and if there is a trend reversal right as we studied in the morning time that trend also reverses that technique applies even to the US market right so for example this if you get something like this this happens this is a death cross over and this is called as technically this is called a death cross over okay and here it means that most likely you are going to get this level at least okay so this becomes your first bulk by point right whatever this number comes out to be right I mean I'll definitely inform you guys but this is there is a very high probability that this will happen okay so I don't know like I'm and in the short term and it's very difficult to give like short term commentary on the market but this is like you know this is very likely to happen right so that's all I can say it looks this way that this will happen on S&P 500 then you buy S&P 500 also okay every on that me okay now if NASDAQ returns are better why do we buy see it's like saying that he HDFC bank that around our better why do you buy a codec you buy a diversify as much as possible you buy good quality asset and good price so if you're getting SP by and good quality which is a good quality asset yes is it available at good price yes you buy that NASDAQ is it a good quality asset yes is it available at a good price right now yes okay so definitely it kind of makes sense to buy okay now in what's our community I will do this only on I can't really show my portfolio to I cannot mix Indian and US stocks okay so it becomes like a regulatory challenge for me right so that's an issue because whenever I'm writing commentary for US stocks I can literally write the words by and sell okay but if I'm by writing commentary on Indian stocks because I'm not say we registered I cannot indicate that I'm increasing people to buy something because it's a nightmare for me so therefore I have separated the community is all together right from that I'm okay but honestly this is not like a sales pitch or anything I mean honestly I'll give you enough information on this class itself so that you can do your portfolio if you are considering building a bigger portfolio then only an RI community kind of makes sense because there I primarily speak about US stocks okay beyond 10 lakhs there is a TCS see TCS gets refunded it's not as if that the government takes away that money for you okay so I'm okay so much consular agree what date is today 30th okay we are a little bit late otherwise you would have transferred money like you know to the model right and then it would not have attracted like TCS but now if you do it in January it's fine but like end of the world okay so it's okay it's I I don't think there is anything that we can do on that okay so anyways I hope that this is clear now comes sectoral index okay and these are called as segment index now these are very important right so please make a note right and these are some high powered segment index for example so XX is semi conductor index this will have companies like NVIDIA this will have company like ASML etc so this is very good if you want to buy a competitor to NASDAQ then you can buy something called as XLK if you want to buy artificial intelligence now this industry in the US is growing at 16 17% okay cyber security is expected to grow another like 18 19% robotics I don't recall the exact growth rate but it is definitely 15% plus cloud computing this is growing at like at least like 15% plus clean energy in the US right this is growing at a very fast rate some are saying that this is growing at more than 30% so these are all good indexes to consider okay everyone with me that what do you do like I mean and this is like where I will write you know sort of give you and I put and give you and I'll put for your level understanding of that okay let's say that you have 10 likes you invested 6 likes in India 4 likes you want to diversify out of India what should you do you should buy 2 lakh broad index this could be NASDAQ this could be S&P 500 yeah 2 lakhs you should buy narrow index for example SOX, robotics, cloud etc right the list that I should okay so these are this is a decent strategy now should you buy like like a blind person no like I mean here you have to go and check for example go and check what is happening on SOX so here you go and okay so you type SOX X okay so you this will indicate I share semiconductor ETF okay now then what do you notice here number 1 trend has changed okay so it is brilliant okay
