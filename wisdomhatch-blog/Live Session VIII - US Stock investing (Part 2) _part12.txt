==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a transcript of a discussion, likely from an investment course or community session, covering various topics related to investing in Indian, US, and Chinese markets, tax implications, residency strategies, and stock-picking advice. The speaker (possibly "Action") addresses queries about market entry timing, leveraging loans for investments, inheritance tax, platform recommendations (e.g., Vested for US/Chinese stocks), and transitioning to full-time trading. Key themes include skepticism toward fund managers, tax optimization strategies (e.g., setting up firms in UAE), and reliance on personal analysis over research reports.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Market Timing:** The China Index has surged ~35%, and its breakout zone may present an entry opportunity.  
- **Leverage Challenges:** Borrowing in the Middle East without local credit history is difficult.  
- **Tax Strategies:**  
  - Inheritance tax typically applies to US citizens, not Indian residents.  
  - Shifting tax residency (e.g., to UAE) can reduce capital gains taxes but requires significant capital (₹3–5 crore+).  
- **Investment Platforms:** Vested is recommended for US/Chinese stocks; Interactive Brokers (IBKR) may also be used.  
- **Full-Time Trading Caution:** Avoid quitting a job unless you have ₹3 crore+ in capital.  
- **Fund Manager Skepticism:** Passive reliance on fund managers or research reports is discouraged; self-analysis is emphasized.  
- **Residency Tricks:** Using a spouse’s Indian account can facilitate investing while being a UAE tax resident.  
- **Sector-Specific Insights:** IT sector’s future is debated—service-oriented models may persist, but human capital cost rises could weaken India’s advantage.  
- **Community Engagement:** The speaker plans to continue commentary on Indian stocks for ~1 year before potentially shifting focus to US markets.  
- **Practical Advice:** Setting up a UAE trading company (9% corporate tax) is viable for large portfolios.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
early right that's the trick okay okay and offer china index it has given a massive run-up recently right I mean probably 35% or so so it's a good time to enter into the index right now it is it is it is on a breakout zone so you can still enter on a problem okay sure thanks yep basil danish I can go yeah hi action so just want to clarify on one thing I mean maybe because you have that experience if if you're investing from I mean being an Indian resident any way of you know kind of taking that leverage I mean say loans in the way and then investing the real estate is that possible very difficult man so I mean if you do not have a credit history in the Middle East why would a bank in Middle East give you any sensible borrowing rates right right okay go ahead and one more thing related to the US stock investing thing which you have of course highlighted along is there a concept of I'm sure that probably you might have looked at it but is there a concept of inheritance text which kind of kicks in because it could be pretty high and it could be a kind of see it's mostly applicable to US citizens not for you right so very your tax domicile is where your inheritance inheritance tax comes into the equation so it might not be applicable to you okay okay thank you thanks thank you actually for your wonderful insight you're really awesome action I enjoyed really enjoyed your course so what I want to understand is that so for US stocks you you recommended vested so what about the Chinese stocks what how can I you can buy Chinese stocks from listed what a problem okay you can also use the same for Chinese stocks okay thank you no round you're evening actually the just want to know one thing through this course do we get an access to the YouTube membership community as well yes so I post the same stuff on WhatsApp for the group okay so if I'm already in existing YouTube community that's what I can so I can wave up that and I can join through the link which we're providing right thank you part of the watch yeah I actually I actually you did mention about you know when you change the taxes and see in the future you can book the profits and then you pay 0% tax especially if you're you pay tax as a rent right for X number of days you need so but if you book the profits bring that money back into India or you become a Indian citizen again does that you know has some tax of it again you know okay but why don't then people do it because then only one 20 days you need to stay I don't know whatever is the X number of days no so it's not easy you know I mean for example you have to come set up a company pay some setup cost so you can only do it if your portfolio size is decent which you mentioned would be upwards of 3CR 3 to 5CR currency yeah so I mean you know this game only makes sense if you're investing more than 3 to 5CR 3CR plus in US stocks thank you so yes hi action thank you so much for conducting the course and running the community it was really informative but I still feel like I'm heavily relying you know on your your commentary or notification with respect to peaking of the stocks so I was just wondering like when when you plan to move your when you will move your portfolio to US like 95% when you'll be done with that will you stop commenting on Indian stocks and if you do that then how do we pick up the stocks that's legitimate like I even I have not heard about it so if I withdraw like 90% of my money from India will I stop commenting on US stocks in Indian stocks probably yes okay so there is no incentive I mean honestly like I genuinely teach whatever I'm doing in the market so okay so yeah it's not a gimmick or anything right but if I genuinely move like 85% of my money I would not speak much about Indian stocks so yeah and in that case how do we select or pick up the stocks oh see good thing is that I will at least run the communities for one year right on Indian stocks right so then you know with time you will get clarity you will get at least one year of practice and after one year one year one year I mean where we are right so likely maybe I'll stop investing in India I don't know let's see yeah okay thank you so much yeah they were in turn out yeah hi thank you for the sorry they were yeah yeah thank you for the session really nice one and also look forward to meeting you in Dubai wanted to ask you a quick question right actually two questions so one is basically when you move from India to Dubai you had from your videos etc I understand that you have a zero the account where you used to trade in India right did you have to change so you would ideally would have changed it to an NRE account right but a lot of brokers don't allow you to essentially hold a brokerage account like for example grow doesn't allow you to hold a brokerage account as an NRE so I'm just trying to understand in India yeah so I'm just trying to understand was it an easy process yes so the idea is for example my wife is an Indian tax resident I'm a UA tax resident that's the trick okay understood okay fine the second question then is around so in UAE when you're investing in US do you still use your vested account that you have changed to UA tax resident or do you use some other I use right now why oh right so I'm building one platform via that I'll use IBKR and I will use vested it's all three I'll be using but you don't look at it or one stuff you haven't looked at it or I don't use it I might do it in the future okay cool thank you very much pranav adalash hi thank you for everything so I wanted to understand I worked in an IT company I'm a stock market I mean they stock my phone 2020 so I want to understand in what scenario you think I should become a full-time trader and leave my current job I made more than much it is the last year but this time okay so unless you have like three crores plus don't leave your job okay that's okay that's my answer okay all right yeah abhila is barataj yeah yeah yeah yeah okay so actually I was investing through this small case the sectorial thing by paying some subscription pay everything so the mid cap small cap everything so I was in profit last year like more than 50 60 percent I think currently my profit is zero now so should I exit from it it I did the selling class right so many it has got nothing to do with how much profit loss you are in see fund managers will not generate an alpha for you right if the market is doing well you will make money with them if the market is not doing well you will lose money with them either way they will make their commissions you are not going to benefit immensely so unless you learn to take the pain of analyzing stocks yourself you will never structurally make money that's the bottom line yeah people get pissed off when I say this but this is a fact right I mean like it or leave it I don't care right so that's how it goes right so like this as a general rule does don't trust fund managers right I mean you are trusting them at least have the vision to withdraw money when time comes okay sure okay thanks so the previous mission that you answered I didn't get the part of where your wife is an Indian citizen how does that help so basically what happens is that if I am a attacks resident of UA then I can't buy direct stocks in India so I will buy it through my wife's account because she is an Indian tax resident if I have to do like that 20 percent Indian investing and also your mentioned about setting up a firm if you want to you know change the attacks residency to UA what do you mean by setting up a firm so you register a company in UA which becomes a trading company and if you have like let's say a five seven CR capital you capitalize it and you trade via that and pay 9 percent corporate tax so the maximum tax applicable for you is 9 percent right because you require like tax residency here so under what visa will you get it so this is called as freelance trading visa right so you can do this right yeah hi actually do we have to use paid version for perplexity I'm using free version in front of you okay okay thank you yeah so are you sure can and they get these research reports or they recommend short term long term they have those three tabs right so on best it are you able to do that because I plan to get on vested yeah but do you do I see don't trust like research report research reports are as good as analysts right so for example I must talk analyst now if you trust my version cool right now you guess might be an analyst you might be an analyst whom would you trust right so just understand the logic and eventually you have to make decisions based on your analysis yeah you guess yeah hi accept first of all a great course I think I'm investing in the markets since 2010 so the point is I made a substantial portion I'm having the CGR of around around 30 percent in this market because obviously due to the time duration I do really understand I'm in the IT industry and really do understand where the products will be that is where the tech is going to take a jump right I just had I just wanted to pick your brain on the 2.0 high now here the service oriented industry and it will remain so most of the company that service oriented I don't think so they're going to go into products because that is not going to happen I don't see that happen and the IT industry right now is down the doldrums let me put it like this right do you think it is a good time to get in and stay put because when the product will come out service industry definitely will benefit either individuals do you think it's a fair ask considering yes because I know I know I might be maybe making you look too far ahead but no so I mean see it's speculative number one right your viewpoint might be different than mine that does not make either of us incorrect right because this is speculative wet right my viewpoint is that India had a service advantage because our human capital was cheap right now that hu
