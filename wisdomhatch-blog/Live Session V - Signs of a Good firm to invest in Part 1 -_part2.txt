SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a discussion on identifying and investing in high-quality, unique assets with limited supply, using real estate and luxury items as examples. The speaker emphasizes that such assets, like heritage properties or rare watches, retain and appreciate in value over time, even if they initially seem expensive or lack immediate cash flow. The speaker shares personal experiences, such as buying a 120-year-old Portuguese villa in Goa, which doubled in value within a year and a half, to illustrate the long-term benefits of holding unique assets. The discussion then shifts to applying similar principles to stocks, stressing the importance of understanding a business's total addressable market (TAM) and future potential, using examples like Zomato and automotors.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Unique Assets Appreciate:** High-quality, scarce assets (e.g., heritage properties, rare watches) retain and grow in value over time, even if purchased at a premium.  
- **Long-Term Focus:** Short-term cash flow may be negligible, but long-term wealth protection and growth are prioritized.  
- **Supply and Demand:** Assets with limited supply (e.g., historic homes, luxury items) are more valuable due to their irreplicability.  
- **Real-World Example:** The speaker’s Portuguese villa in Goa doubled in value in 1.5 years due to its rarity and historical significance.  
- **Application to Stocks:** Investing in businesses requires analyzing their total addressable market (TAM) and future growth potential (e.g., Zomato’s expansive TAM vs. automotors’ narrower scope).  
- **Investment Strategy:** Focus on quality over price, hold assets long-term, and diversify portfolios with unique, high-growth opportunities.  
- **Wealth Protection:** Some investments (e.g., non-liquid assets) are not for short-term gains but for preserving and growing wealth over decades.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
se I've given them like theoretical yarn. Okay. So like I'm a cab. I don't know you right and you meet me at like airport lounge or whatever. And then you say that you could watch or other do stuff. So I'm going to write. So what will I say? It makes no sense. Right. So either join my course. So that's what the which I make like whatever sales date. Okay. So bottom line being that you know see and honestly I'm not trying to trick them. This is genuine thing right because this needs to be seen in context of your portfolio which you will study tomorrow. So for the timing will park the point about your portfolio on the side that we will try to cover tonight or tomorrow morning. But getting an understanding of these two things is very important. All these simple things. Right. And it's called real estate. You just try to pick this from a real estate example. That for example, if you buy like a very good quality land. Okay. In Bangalore. And let's say that you buy it like 30% 40% expensive even today. Okay. Because you don't understand like real estate and you don't understand like real estate pricing. Okay. Now, okay, fine in the short term like maybe on a three or four year five year basis. You will feel that you know what? You'll think that you're not going up. Okay. But if you expand the horizon 1520 30 years for tears and if you keep retaining that land. Do you think that you know that 30% premium that you've given today it's going to be bad for you? Probably not why because you have purchased an extremely good quality asset. Okay. I'll give you from my own example. So I bought a Portuguese villa in Goa. Okay. And I bought it for four years. Okay. In 2022. Now I had an understanding of what a good quality asset is and the valuation of it because this is my full time job. Right. So I bought it right and now I'm getting offers on it at 8.59. Okay. So like 100% growth into one and a half years. I'll say that you're going to go you again all this stuff. So I'll help you understand what a good quality asset is. Okay. Now why do you think that this is a good quality asset? You'll say that okay. Land probably like location probably like this. No. Land basically see. I mean the way to think about real estate is that he can I buy this at this price. Now, or will I be able to find some other property like this? Okay. So that is the way to think. Okay. So what is that house? Right. So it's a 120 year old heritage home. Okay. Now how many Portuguese 120 year houses are there in Goa right now? Let's say how? Let's say 10,000. Okay. After 30 years, how many do you think will remain? Maybe 5000. So the point is that this is a good quality asset because the more unique the asset is the better it is. Right. For example, I'm like I have no I do not like watches. Okay. I have never won a watch. Right. So I don't wear watch. I don't wear any jewelry or whatever. Right. But if I have to why watch I'll buy like Patrick Philip. Now why unlimited edition Patrick Philip it costs like close to a crore right and I'll probably the it's the only piece of like an luxury item I'll buy from that angle rather than buying a car. I drive a truck to mix all. Now why because it's a great investment. Why? Because it will there is no supply of those items. Right. Similarly, like for example, the Portuguese villa that I bought. There is a 120 year old history associated with it. No one can create time. Right. Now I can always advertise 30 years from now when I'm like whatever like 68 or something. 67 68 then I can always advertise it as 150 year old Portuguese house. How many 150 year old Portuguese houses will be there? And that would be zero because people are buying and builders are buying such houses demolishing it and creating four villas out of it. I have no need for cash flow. Okay. So I'll just retain it and do nothing on it. Right. And if I have to just do remand better innovated. So this will go up in value. So I hope everyone understands that what is a meaning of a good quality asset. Right. Good quality asset is that something which retains its value and has limited supply. Now it cannot be a completely unique product. It cannot be like Mona Lisa. For example, similarly if you get an opportunity to buy Taj Mahal at I don't know. 500 billion dollars. Should you buy it? Yes. Okay. Why at whatever price? Okay. The reason is that the reason is the reason is that there is only one Taj Mahal that is going to be there in the world with the history that comes with it. So buying like heritage homes, buying these type of things. If you get a 4 to 2 and if you can retain. It's probably the best investment strategy that I'm not exaggerating. So like land you can always buy like etc. etc. things you can always buy. So what smart investors have started to do is that they now these homes are not livable. For example, the house that I bought that Portuguese one that is livable. But majority of these homes because they are so old they are not livable. So what are investors started to do now that they will buy such a house. They will retain the front facade of the house and then rebuild the back and still advertise it as like a 150 year old Portuguese house or whatever. That's not authentic. That's gimmicky. Right. But sometimes you can find such deals. Okay. So even if some of you come and say that you know we want to buy a house at 20s here. The answer will be no. I have no intention of selling it. Okay. So yeah. No. So it's not I'm not looking at it from a super short term basis. It's a unique asset. I'll just retain it and do nothing of it. Okay. So that's the point. Okay. So yeah. So that's a bottom line. And I hope that that example. Kind of gives you a sense right as to what a unique asset means. It's very easy to explain it on real estate. For example, what else right for example, if let's say that you have an apartment with a great view or something or penthouse, you know, most luxury development. That's that's again a unique proposition. Why do you think that penthouses get sold very easily. This is the reason why. Okay. So the luxury you get or the luxury items you get now buying such luxury items. What do they do. They actually destroy your cash flow. Guess how much money or early rent time making on that Portuguese house. And there is zero. Now some genius will come and say that charcoal or a group team will allow to take out of the stuff. No, I'm not trying to solve that problem. My goal is wealth protection. Now that four will go to like you know I've already got to eight and a half nine. After 10 years, it will be 17, 18, 20. Okay. So it will automatically I'm not bothered about like cash flow on it for cash. I have other assets. Okay. So that's how you need to plan your portfolio bottom line mean that if you buy like a high quality asset. Right. And retain it. It will grow in value. Right. We are not talking about price. But yes, the goal of investing is very simple that you buy something which is super high quality. Right. And then grow it in and then buy it at the right price if possible. So if you're doing these two things, then you will make a lot of money. Right. Now doing this on stocks is really complicated because with that Portuguese house, you can always think you're trying to want to. Yeah. Of course, it makes sense. But how do you think about this on stocks. So for that, you need to understand business analysis. Right. So the first. So I'll take you through like 17, 18 points. Right. How about business analysis and use different examples. So the goal of this is to create something called as investment canvas. Now what exactly is investment canvas. I'll tell you, right. And we will use some examples. Okay. So let me just see if my board is getting retained for just a minute. I don't know if it will. So but let me take examples. Okay. HDFC bank. Let's pick. Okay. Let's pick different different types of forms. Okay. Now, we pick. Okay. This is a small cap company, which else which one let's pick Britannia right. It's about a month. Okay. Let's pick Zumato. Right. So let's pick a manufacturing company like page industries. Okay. So these are like five different types of businesses that we will pick. And we will just use these as case studies on today's class. Okay. All right. So the first key thing that you need to think about like for example, I have five lakh rupees where should I invest. What is the first thing that you should think about it. Okay. Let me figure out a high quality asset. So what is the first rule of picking a high quality asset that it's time should be high. Right. So what is the meaning of time in investing world or startup world means total addressable market. Okay. Now two examples here. Right. So for example, if you pick time of automotors. What's this? If you pick time of Zumato, where do you think time will be higher? The meaning of time is that how many people or it market can it go and acquire for example, if the population of India is let's say, you know, one forty crores. Can Zomato probably target all one forty crores. What about automotors? How big the time will be. So where do you think that time will be more? Of course, Zomato, but here you're thinking about the current business of Zomato. Think about the future business of Zomato, which is reasonable. For example, Zomato, can it go into concert tickets? Yes. Can it go into let's say owning an IPL team. Probably I don't know. Right. Can it go into Singapore market? Yes. Can it go into Dubai market? It probably was and I think they. The wind wound the shop. Can they go into the island? Yes. Can they go into like even launching their own EVs? Why not? They probably can. They can probably for example, if they're total driver network is it's like 50, 60 lakhs. Why can't they launch? Provide them that option of, you know, just creating that. So the time or the total addressable market of Zomato is much bigger compared to. To data motors, right. Everyo
