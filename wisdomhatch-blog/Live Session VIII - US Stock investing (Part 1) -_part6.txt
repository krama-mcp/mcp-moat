SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses the challenges of financial transparency in Indian companies, using examples like Satyam to highlight how even publicly listed firms may manipulate their books. They emphasize treating startups and smaller companies with caution, akin to small-cap investments. The talk then shifts to personal wealth management, outlining a three-stage portfolio strategy based on liquidity and cash flow generation. Key advice includes prioritizing liquid assets early, transitioning to fixed-supply assets (like property, gold, or Bitcoin) as wealth grows, and considering tax efficiency and generational planning for high-net-worth individuals.  

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Corporate Transparency Issues:** Even large Indian companies like Satyam may engage in financial misreporting; startups often prioritize revenue growth over accurate profit reporting.  
- **Investment Caution:** Treat startups/smaller companies like small-cap stocks—higher risk, not comparable to stable blue-chip firms.  
- **Wealth Stages:**  
  1. **Liquid Wealth Stage (Early):** Focus on easily accessible assets (stocks, mutual funds, FDs).  
  2. **Liquid + Cash Flow Stage (Mid):** Maintain 60–70% liquidity while adding income-generating assets (property, royalties).  
  3. **Life Stage (Advanced):** Include tax-efficient structures and generational planning.  
- **Fixed-Supply Assets:** Critical in high-inflation economies (e.g., property, gold, Bitcoin)—government has limited control over these.  
- **Tax & Legacy Planning:** High-net-worth individuals should invest in tax residency advice and plan for children’s future opportunities.  
- **Actionable Steps:** Aim for ₹25 lakhs in liquid assets first, then diversify into cash-flow assets; prioritize assets outside strict government control.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 say, okay. I hope that this point is clear I have a different new public unless you have to disclose their financial Uh Very valid point, but even publicly listed companies are throwing whatever data they feel like, okay, for example um Sathya right now Sathya was one of the top 10 companies in India entire book was cooked, okay Um, so not necessarily true now again. I'm giving you an exceptional example here, right? Now when it comes to bottom line being that see either reporting standards in India or not that high, okay Why they're going to be listed key why they're going to be listed key so it's not as if key uh, yeah, so Internal books are cooked up really well. Yeah, so it is right. I'm not so what do you think about mom earth? Okay, so What what do you guys think about like uh, patium, okay? That's the part and parcel of every startup that they will for example first and foremost try to get a lot of revenues Then they will try to you know book profits early reported that way. This is happening at every firm So what I'm trying to tell you is that this is not just swiggy oyo ola Story At least the product should make sense at least like you know some assets should be their nica So it's it's there with everything right so and therefore I'm saying that these companies you have to treat them like a small cap I'm not saying that you know, these are like etuls or like you know HDFC bank type of companies right even HDFC bank maybe right when they might be maximizing profits And you know sort of doing all that it's just that the extent of that is less. Okay Okay, all right, uh, okay, so I hope that this point is clear that these are major broad steps that you need to take in order to make these type of returns Okay, now comes portfolio by age many of you say that here and odd I'm like 25 you tell me like portfolio It does not nothing to do with it your portfolio will go through three steps. Okay, one is called as liquid wealth step Stage two is called as liquid plus cash flow step Stage three is called as liquid plus cash flow plus life state. Okay, now this might happen when you're 10 years old This might or you have inherited like you know, like kind of 1500 crores worth of stock from your grandpa Narayan Murthy right so that you might be five and yeah, that's separate You're already at stage three now you might be like you know 60 with a lot of obligations So then you have stood yet stage one, okay, whatever typically it devices that if I've just started investing Then If you're young, okay, so this stage here majority of your wealth should be liquid. Okay, so 25 lakhs should be pure liquid wealth It could be in index stock markets usual funds FD's Anything okay, but it should be liquid liquid means that you can pull out the money really fast, okay If you want the money tomorrow, you get it to move. Okay, so this is very important. Don't even think about anything else Till the time you hit this number basic number, okay Once you have more than 25 right so it might be between 25 lakhs to 50 lakhs to 75 lakhs, right Then what do you do? Then you at least keep 60% of your wealth liquid 60 70% of your wealth at least liquid, okay Up even in stage two, okay Now idea should be to get to one crore of liquid wealth, okay, once you do this then you start focusing more on cash flows, okay At least first cash flow asset you should have now first cash flow asset could be E for most people it would be a property Which gives you rent, okay Some of them might own a blog give log A business It could be a book that generates a royalty It could be any of these things, okay, so it could be any of these things right Whatever you sing for majority of the people this might be a property These are not dividend-wing stocks, right? dividend-wing stocks are liquid dividend-wing stocks do not have a fixed supply if you say that hey, I do not have a property I cannot buy a property own some btc if you don't trust btc it's fine own some little bit of gold, okay These are fixed supply assets Okay, and owning fixed supply assets When you are at that stage do is absolutely critical in a high inflation country like India if you're not owning Cash flows slash fixed supply asset. It's a problem, okay If you can't buy it in Bangalore it's fine buy it in Bangalore, okay If you can't buy it in Bangalore by somewhere else whichever like to you if you can't even do that by agricultural land Okay, so wherever which ever stayed you off from like a little bit, okay, but own some fixed supply assets It's critical. This is a critical lesson that I've learned in the last three four years I was lucky also that I started buying a lot of properties from 2021 to 2021 Massive purchases. I'm very happy with every single unit that I've purchased right Very happy with that decision 100% standby, okay, so Because the first step Is and here you need to understand the concept of government money and retail money, okay? Wall street money and mean street money the entire goal of the money system is Government when you do a mutual fund who controls the money government how we will instruct LIC That's the point okay now then comes that okay if you invest money in gold ETF who controls that money government, okay if you buy You know so can be a summary of the use deny EPF NPS XYZ All that money there literally money can be divided into two okay either it is government control or does not government control, okay What is not government control land? Land is also government controlled in a way, but it's less government control government cannot come tomorrow and create a special law To take off your land, okay, it's very difficult, okay So on a scale of one to ten it's very difficult for the government to take and freeze your land so to say okay So it's fixed supply asset, okay, number two gold if you have physical gold in your territory Okay, so can government come and take it very difficult cannot theoretically take it in as it can do anything it has army in its control So you can of course like you know grab your gold also, but very difficult to do okay now Say any as a gold grabbing through you see India's you can be here, right? So I mean I'm from warrior so do that This India gets a truck and you know gold, right? So they read about that right? So no so that was the case, okay So it used to be the case, okay, so that is there Bitcoin, right? If you have physical if you have Bitcoin on your hardware wallet can government take it? No, yeah If you are rich if you are a three-search five-search plus guy Start thinking about tax residences start thinking about efficient tax structuring Understand how tax structuring works pay for this advice if you have to pay someone not me I don't do this work, right? But sit with someone who understands can explain you all these points, right help you Structure your taxes properly. It's worth it, okay? I have personally spent like on one-on-one consultations Understanding where my tax residency etc would kind of make sense. I've spent close to five lacks getting that consultation Okay, so and I'm very happy with it because it has saved me more than like you know four or five crores of taxes already So which is crazy, right? So it's definitely worth it if you are at that scale do it, okay? If you are thinking about next generation if you have young kids etc etc Very important to think from their angle where are they going to get opportunities Where they are going to get high quality jobs? You have to start making those moves, okay? So that's it. That's where I'll stop this, okay? Now we'll take a five-minute break. So we will come back at five of six, okay, and then we will do the US stock investing class, okay
