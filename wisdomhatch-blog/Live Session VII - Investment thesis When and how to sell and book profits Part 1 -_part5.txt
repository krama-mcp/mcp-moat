==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text discusses stock market investing strategies, focusing on **PE (Price-to-Earnings) contraction/expansion**, **consolidation zones**, and **multi-bagger stocks** (2x–5x returns). It emphasizes buying stocks in consolidation patterns below their average PE, citing examples like Titan and IDFC First Bank. The speaker highlights the importance of **sector growth**, **market cap**, and **EPS growth** for identifying multi-baggers. Risks are stressed—large returns require enduring significant volatility (e.g., 30–50% drops). The text also compares speculative investments (e.g., unlisted stocks, Bitcoin) to traditional stocks, arguing that trust (e.g., in banking) and technology understanding (e.g., Bitcoin’s blockchain) are critical. The speaker advises limiting exposure to high-risk assets (2.5–5% of portfolio).

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. **PE Expansion/Contraction**: Stocks trading below average PE in consolidation zones (e.g., rectangular patterns) may offer buying opportunities for future PE expansion.  
2. **Multi-Bagger Traits**: Small market cap, low PE, growing EPS, and sector tailwinds (e.g., Titan benefiting from organized jewelry sector growth).  
3. **Risk vs. Reward**: High-return stocks (2x–5x) come with high volatility (20–50% drops); investors must tolerate short-term losses.  
4. **Banking Sector**: Trust is key—avoid banks you wouldn’t trust for long-term deposits (e.g., Yes Bank vs. HDFC Bank).  
5. **Speculative Assets**: Bitcoin/unlisted stocks (e.g., NSC) are akin to speculative bets; limit allocation (2.5–5% of portfolio).  
6. **Profit Booking**: Regular small profit-taking (e.g., 15%) prevents frustration during sideways markets.  
7. **Historical Examples**: Amazon’s 90% drop in the early 2000s underscores the volatility of even high-growth companies.  
8. **Sector Expansion**: Bet on companies expanding market share (e.g., IDFC First’s branch growth mirroring Titan’s sector dominance).  
9. **Tech Understanding**: Bitcoin’s resilience stems from its proven technology; ignorance leads to misguided fears.  
10. **Unlisted Stocks**: High-risk, early-stage investments (seed/VC phase) require deep due diligence.  

*Note: The text is fragmented but revolves around disciplined investing, risk management, and identifying growth opportunities.*

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ll to 15 and at one point in time it was like 30. Okay. So here I think that at one point in time it was 48. And it fell all the way till like 15 16. Okay. So this is massive P contraction. Now of stock like P judge. Can you buy them at consolidation zones. Okay. So for example this this is a consolidation zone. Right. So this is forming forming a rectangular pattern. Okay. This is forming a rectangular pattern. Okay. And it is below its average P. Okay. So this is average P everyone gets it. And this is forming a rectangular below its average P. Okay. So this is these are two conditions that are getting it. Now from here what it indicators. They can see. I have a P.E. Nietzsche. So P will not fall below this right much. Okay. Even if it falls maybe like 5 10% P drop will happen. Most likely likely it is going to expand. For example. This this part was what rectangular pattern below its average P. Okay. So this is average P. And this is forming an rectangular pattern below its average P. If you would have bought it here you would have benefited from the P.E. Expansion because the P went from what 22 all the way till 35 right. So this expansion was there. Okay. Now the problem that happens is that people will buy it here. Right. For example you bought it here. Right. Then it went up it went it down. It went up it went it down. And then you'll get frustrated. Okay. You'll say again. I'm going to say 100 to please now it has again become 100 to please only. Okay. And after like whatever like 2.5 years. You are getting frustrated here because you're not doing any regular profit booking. Okay. Everyone with me but if you trade those channels book little little profits yesterday some of you are asking me that why you're booking like 15% profits on like you know XYZ stocks. This is the reason. Okay. So that you don't feel that frustration at least push the profit up in the book here. Everyone gets it. Okay. Okay. Good. So now the final type of stocks that I want to cover is called as 2x to 5x stocks or multi baggers. Okay. Now people ask me that you can you tell me like a framework for finding multi-vaggers is he going to tell. Okay. So if no one knows how to find multi-vaggers but a multi-vagger has the following traits. Okay. Number one the market cap is small. Okay. The P is generally little. Okay. So and the EPS. The EPS is growing. Okay. Or the EPS grows. And finally the interest comes in stock. Okay. A classic case study is Titan. Okay. When the Rakesh engine was a big Titan in 2002 I think right somewhere around that time. Titan was at like 34 rupees stock. Okay. Its market cap was very low. Right. Maybe like whatever 20 euros. Okay. It's PE was very low. Okay. EPS was growing because the industry was growing. This is a very important point that what was happening at on Titan. Well, the jewelry sector was getting organized. What is the meaning of jewelry sector getting organized? Right. Instead of having so many there will be like one Titan. When Titan was just expanding right. Very similar traits one could argue can be seen on IDFC first. Okay. We had spoken about this earlier. For example, the market cap of IDFC first is 45,000 crore. Okay. HDFC bank is how many 1.4 lakh crore. Okay. So IDFC first is 20x smaller. Okay. And if for example, if this is a map of India and if IDFC first bank is like it's only these many branches. But if over the next 10 years it goes like this. If it creates so many branches. Then what do you think is going to happen to IDFC first business. Well, it will at least 4x 5x. Right. So what is the bet that you're taking on IDFC first. You are looking at 2x 3x expansion on their banking branches. That's it. Okay. Now is that required. Yes. Is there a benefit of having banking branches. Yes. Why? Because banking is a trust based business. You would not trust a complete online bank. For example, Jupiter is an online bank. Will you trust it in India? No. Right. I will give you money. Which branch will I go and do that now? Right. So then you will not you know that becomes an issue. At least branches are there. So you can go and grab someone's color or whatever. Right. So I mean, at least that option is there with you. So therefore I feel very weird like putting money in like Y. Okay. Reason is it's a complete online bank. It has great interface in UA and it's back to the first taboo that we bank and all that. But it does not have branches. That's a problem. Right. So if I have to deposit like safe money, I'll do it with ADCV and Fav and all that. Okay. So that's the point. Okay. So everyone gets this. These are some of the traits of these companies to go up. Okay. So this is one. Now I see zero difference between Bitcoin, unlisted stocks and stocks where I'm doing some kind of speculation. For example, IDFC first. I'm doing speculation. What is the speculation that it's banking branches will go for X in the next 10 years. Okay. With short term price movement, if it falls by minus 20, do I care not really? Okay. As long as my thesis is intact that they are going to expand fast. Okay. I'll give you some good times. Welcome. And then they will make money. Now, important point to note on these two X 5X assets is very simple. That's a you cannot make two X 5X returns without taking two X 5X risks. There is no free return. Okay. So for example, if you cannot even handle like a 20% fall on IDFC first, do not invest. Okay. If you can't handle like 30 40% fall on something like I know PVR. Do not invest. Okay. If you can't handle 30 40 50% fall on. Let's say something like a dream folks do not invest. Okay. So that's simple. You cannot expect like a company to go like 4X without even taking a hit of 50% on that particular stock. Okay. So I put any investment here. You know, you can actually put for context. Let me just show you something interesting. So for example, this is Amazon. Okay. Amazon Inc. Okay. Okay. So now if you take a look at Amazon. Okay. Now this is 2022. It was a multi trillion dollar company. It fell by 54%. Okay. A large cap multi trillion dollar company falling by 54%. Right. This was a 54% fall on Amazon. Okay. This. When Amazon was a small company, do you guys know how much did it's market cap erode by right. So for example, if you go to early 2000s. Okay. For example, you have a big wall. Let's show. Let's not show. Okay. So this is it. For example. Okay. So if you take a look. Okay. So if you study. If you felt like in early 2000s, right. That. Okay. You know what Amazon is a great company. How much did the value erode by it got eroded by almost 92%. Okay. It's a great thing. Right. I mean, for example, 90% erosion of capital. Now if I TVR I know, I'll be filled by 30% 40% and people are crying like anything right. And you know what actually do. You know, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't know. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care. I don't care and there are not guests that talk about it. etc. See, yes, bank is not a high-quality asset. It just does not make any sense. Banking is a trust-based business. Tell me this, would you be comfortable doing a 10-year FD with a yes bank? If the answer is no, why would you buy a yes bank stock? Will you be comfortable doing a 10-year FD with a HDFC bank or Kotec bank? Probably yes. So that's the bottom line. So that's the bottom line. If you don't trust someone in a banking business, there is no point in giving money there. If you want to speculate, rather better approaches, rather than giving money to a yes bank, give it to Bitcoin. There is already a 35-40% margin of safety. Bitcoin is a tech-based asset. Look, I think Bitcoin technology will fail. What are the waiting for? What technology to fail? It's already closed to a 10-million dollar asset. When will hacking happen? It's already out there. If hacking happened on that layer 1 blockchain network, it would have already happened. So I understand that tech. Now, I cannot explain you right on this class because it's a little bit complex topic. But if you understand that tech of Bitcoin, then honestly, there is nothing to fear. Many people ask stupid questions around Bitcoin. If all that, 21 million Bitcoin then why would even miners be present on the network? All these are legitimate questions, but it's lack of knowledge regarding Bitcoin. Understand that. That is where knowledge alpha comes from. This goes beyond the course per view, so I will not enter there. But I hope you got the perspective. For me, there is zero difference between buying Bitcoin and unlisted stock like NSC. Now, how much of my portfolio will I put on something like NSC between 2.5% to 5%. Which brings us to the final topic for this session, which has to do with unlisted stocks. Unlisted stocks. What is the meaning of unlisted stocks? So basically, a stock goes through three important phases. One is called as seed2vc. The second phase is called as... The second phase is called as IPO. And third phase is called as public market. For example, public market stocks right now are BSC. Seed2vc stage. Now, here, there are a range of companies. For example, if you take a look at something like, let's say, let's pick the example of Zomato. Now, when Zomato started back in whatever early 2000, it was like the size of the company was like this. Then VC series A funding happened. They got li
