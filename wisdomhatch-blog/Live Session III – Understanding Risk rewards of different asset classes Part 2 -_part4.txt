==================================================

SUMMARY:
The speaker advises being heavily invested (around 70%) in the stock market currently, as valuations are fair based on historical returns (5-year CAGR of ~13-14%). They recommend keeping a 20% cash hedge and avoiding frequent tracking of investments, instead adopting a 3-year hold strategy. The speaker emphasizes the importance of investing large amounts ("high ticket" investments) to significantly grow net worth, rather than focusing solely on high growth rates. They illustrate how to capitalize on market downturns (e.g., averaging down) and sideways markets, stressing long-term compounding. Key concepts include disciplined entry points, capital rotation, and leveraging bulk investments during dips (e.g., 10-15% drops). The speaker also critiques following institutional investors (DIIs/FIIs) reactively, advocating for proactive investing ahead of market movements.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Fair Market Valuation**: Current stock market valuations are reasonable (5-year CAGR ~13-14%), justifying ~70% investment with a 20% cash buffer.  
- **Long-Term Focus**: Avoid short-term tracking; hold investments for at least 3 years to benefit from compounding.  
- **Net Worth Growth**: Prioritize investing substantial amounts ("high ticket" capital) in stable assets over chasing high growth rates. A 12% return on a large sum impacts net worth more than 20% on a small sum.  
- **Opportunistic Investing**: Buy aggressively during parabolic drops (10-15% declines) and sideways markets by averaging down or rotating capital.  
- **Efficient Market Hypothesis**: Reacting to institutional investment news (DIIs/FIIs) is ineffective; anticipate their moves and invest earlier.  
- **Mathematical Approach**: Calculate potential returns based on discount-to-peak valuations (e.g., 11% drop + 30% rise = 42% return over 3 years).  
- **Retail Advantage**: Small investors can flexibly average down or rotate capital to enhance returns beyond buy-and-hold strategies.  
- **Mindset Shift**: Investing success hinges on understanding net worth compounding, entry timing, and capital allocation—not just portfolio growth rates.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 buy. Right. You should at least be like 70% invested in the stock market right now because you're getting it at a fair valuation. OK. How fair valuation? Because if you check the last five years, the total return as of today is around 93%, which gives it a CAGR of roughly 14%, 13%, which is honestly not that high. Right. So I mean, it's OK. I mean, it's a little bit maybe you can say like you know, a little bit slightly overvalued. So at the best, so just simply keep like a 20% cash hedge if you want to rest of the money should be in. OK. But having said this, the important notice that please don't track this money for the next three years. You track it only you open a specific account and call it like whatever, actions, class account or whatever, right? Just put it and check it after three years. OK. That's all you need to do. OK. And if I make an announcement from my side, see now what will happen is that you might the stock market can go sideways. OK. And they're also I'm giving. And they're also I'm giving you like a very specific way of making money. Right. So what is the way of making money in a sideways market? See, what is the worst case scenario that will happen? The worst case scenario is this. OK. So for example, let's consider this range. OK. So if you fall like this and it will go up like this, it will fall like this, it will go up like this. This is the worst case scenario or worst possibility that would happen. So if you can downward average more at these intervals and you exit it here, honestly, you have made good money in this timeframe. So this is what we are. I'm OK. You can easily make money in our the the toughest market to invest is our icing market. That's a worst time to buy. So for the last two years, I've struggled to buy anything right. Why? I said, right, even now, you, I want to invest $1 million. I have the money. I can do it. But the point is that it's not getting discounted that much. OK. So your point of entry as I was explaining you yesterday is critical. And you can only maintain a high network on stock investing and create substantial difference to your network. If you understand these three, four key concepts that I taught you today, which brings me to the final concept that I wanted to teach. And then we will in the evening, we'll discuss more about fundamentals. See, this brings us to the concept of network and let me give you two options. OK. Let's say that your total network is one. Now what one how one could write. So for example, you might own a house of 50,000 you own like some mutual funds. You have a job on going. You have some family wealth, etc, etc. Right. Things are going to pass you a house, right. Off 50 lakhs. Then sub add, correct one crore. OK. So even parents wealth, you can include in this. Now, of course, if your parents don't like you, that's a separate thing that they will do. They will not give you like, you know, their house or and give it to your sister or whatever. Right. So that's a separate thing. Then you can delete that wealth. Right. But anyways, this is how you'll reach your net worth computation. Understood. How broad? OK. Now, let me give you two options. OK. One is that let's see. So that's a very clear viewpoint that and you are getting like, let's say 10 lakhs. Okay. That's what you want. OK. Now, if you now you have two options, one is that an amateur investor, what they will do is that they will invest one like now because 10 lakhs of them, so the only thing and all that stuff. And they grow it at like 20%. So what is the final corpus 1.2 lakhs? How much did you add to your net worth 1.2%? OK. And here you're growing at 20%. OK. And investor might invest all right and grow it at 12%. So this becomes 12 lakhs. Here how much net worth you have added? You have added 12% to your net worth here. Here you have added 1.2% of your net worth. What is the primary difference? The primary difference is the investment capital. OK. So your net worth, which is ultimately the goal of investing, the ultimate goal of investing is to increase your net worth. It comes from what? It comes from investing high ticket amounts on sensible assets where you can make stable returns over a long period in time. Have you ever even understand? Right now how you can apply this knowledge? Very simple. So nifty right now is available at an 11% discount. OK. Let's say that you have 10 lakhs. You put all that 10 lakhs here. OK. Now this is 11% discounted. OK. Now over the next three years, right? It will dance like this and all that stuff. At least mutual fund guys will have to give you 9 to 10%. So nifty will be 9 to 10% banega. OK. So which means what? That we will see over the next three years, 30% rise from the base price. OK. From this high, there will be 30%. OK. Add another 12% right from here to here, right? Because the fall was 11%. But the rise will be 12%. OK. So how much return will you make? So you will make 42% overall return on this capital. OK. So this becomes how much? Right. Whatever that. And how much is the percentage addition to your network? So this becomes 14 lakhs, right? So the total network addition becomes 14%. So this is the math that you need to understand broadly speaking. Everyone understanding my viewpoint. It's all about net worth compounding. It's not about at what? Growth rate your portfolio is growing. But how big part of your portfolio is growing at what? Growth rate. OK. Everyone understands. OK. All right. So I'm just saying this was a different perspective to investing that you got. And getting an opportunity to invest in bulk, right? Whenever the opportunity comes, it's the fastest way of growing your network. If you see a parabolic drop, great time to increase your network. OK. If you see a 10% 15% drop, great time to at least be invested substantially. OK. If you see opportunity to capital rotate, do it. OK. All these things is what will add to your network. Can you also shed some light on how ask and bid work? It does not matter, man. I mean, for example, if you're buying like a GFC bank, and if you want to select tomorrow, it will get sold. So that's not a problem. OK. See, that's a very good question that should we start buying when DII is by? OK. So for example, if you study this on perplexity, for example, how much cash is mutual funds in India holding? OK. Now this will tell you. OK. Guys, NSE share is good. I will write a note. I will be buying, right? And again, I'll give you like a link to use for incorrect. Please buy a buyer that you will get at discount because you guys are my stock market student. So and I am an angel investor. So I negotiate like special deals with them. Otherwise, you will end up buying like a slightly higher price. OK. So see, the cash allocation has a percentage. Major mutual fund house like this is this on percentage. And you will tell me, right? Yeah, holding right now. OK. OK. So cash allocations rising from 4.8 to 5.76. OK. I see, I see it. I can't cash in all that stuff. See, the problem that happens is that for example, if they are holding, let's say, 5% 6% of their portfolio in cash. OK. And if this EMC decides to buy tomorrow morning at 9 a.m. OK, stocks. They will pour this entire liquidity into the market. 5,000 crore or whatever. OK. Stocks will go up. You will get the news at 2 p.m. And now you'll have to buy here. Now, do you see the problem in following what DIIs are doing? And you add after what DIIs have done or FIIs have done? This is the problem. OK. So this is called as market efficient market hypothesis. Eugene Farma was an economist who gave this concept that the moment a news comes out, it gets absorbed into the markets and more specifically into the stock prices. OK. So you will not make money by copying DIIs. You will make money by understanding that FIIs will have to invest this money at some stage. And you invest sooner than them and benefit with them. You're getting what I'm trying to say. OK. So you don't react on news, right? You basically try to figure out, OK, this is what is likely to happen in the next 3 to 4 months. OK. Or this is likely to happen in the next 3 years because next 3 years are very easy to think. What will definitely happen in the next 3 years? The markets are going to give make a newer high. OK. What is the current high on the markets? The current high on the market is this much. OK. This is the high that has been made 26,000. We are here. So how much returns we are definitely going to make? Well, 1.5%, 13%. Right. So this is definite, which is what you should do. On an average market gives how much returns 12% top 12, even with Mano, at least to keep the stock market alive, where retail investors are not going away from the stock market by closing their SITs forever. Let's say that we are able to pocket this alpha of 12.5%. OK. This is one. Second, we are taking a 3 year view point on an average market gross 12.5%. OK. But I was, but we are assuming let's say 10. So Maria Gravelna should be correct. So 30% from the peak, it should be. So you eat this. So you add this 30 plus 12.5. So this makes 43. And you divide it by 3. Right. So how much do you get? You at least get like 14% no. Correct. With me everyone. OK. The only challenge would be that you know what? It will fall like this more and it will rise by like. It will fall more. It might like it might rise like this. OK. On top of this, this 14% is assuming that you buy and hold. But no one is stopping you from number one downward averaging because you might get new money here. Right. And rotating capital. So you can rotate the capital even twice. So your returns can become more. OK. And that is the benefit of being a small retail investor. Everyone is understanding all these math. Right. How roughly I'm doing it. OK. OK. So this is it. So I hope you enjoy the class. Right. What I'll do is and I'll take some questions and in the evening time. So this is how stock market is typically operated
