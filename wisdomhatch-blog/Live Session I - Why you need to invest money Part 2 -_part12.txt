==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text is a conversational discussion about investment strategies and tax implications, particularly for someone moving from Singapore (or UAE) back to India. The speaker advises diversifying investments by limiting exposure to any single stock to 10% or less. They also discuss capital gains tax rules, emphasizing the need to verify tax liabilities under the double taxation avoidance agreement (DTAA) between India and Singapore/UAE. The speaker suggests selling Indian stocks before moving back to India if Singapore/UAE does not impose capital gains tax, but highlights uncertainty about India's tax laws and recommends consulting a Chartered Accountant (CA).

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Diversify investments**: Avoid having more than 10% exposure to a single stock, even if it's your employer's stock.  
- **Sell mature stocks strategically**: Reinvest proceeds into other similar companies to maintain a balanced portfolio.  
- **Tax implications for relocation**: Verify capital gains tax rules under the DTAA between India and Singapore/UAE before moving back to India.  
- **India's tax laws**: India may still impose capital gains tax despite DTAA, so selling stocks before relocating could be beneficial if the current country (e.g., Singapore/UAE) has no capital gains tax.  
- **Consult a professional**: Seek advice from a CA to clarify tax liabilities and avoid double taxation.  
- **Uncertainty**: The speaker acknowledges gaps in their knowledge and stresses the need for further verification.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
e best strategy for me I will I will teach portfolio building probably tomorrow night right so maybe it will make more sense then but quick answer is that you should not have exposure to one single asset means one single stock of more than 10% ever right even if you're working for that company right so that's the simplest thing that I will say that you sell some of your stocks as you and when they are maturing and have like investments in other similar companies if you understand okay yeah I have been selling every now and then but I'm not sure what to do with that cash you buy more yeah I mean buy some of that yes yes yes yes yeah hi Akshak can you have me so I'm up right now and so I'm also planning to go back to India as well so and I have a investment in India Indian market right now and today I claim that ltcg sorry this benefit because of double taxation treaty now if I go back to India is does it does it make sense for me to sell all the stocks before moving back to India and then again for you there is no capital gains tax are you sure that's what my C8 only but I left a double check so I'm here for us two years and I'm only investing not with going in capital gains tax for Singapore tax resident is zero but you have to pay taxes in India right so that's the point okay so I'm not sure it just double check it I'm not because I'm not doing it in Singapore I don't know but the rule for UAE is that for example or whatever investments I have in India the moment I sell it I have to pay taxes in India for sure right so that's the same problem that has been happening right despite UAE having zero percent capital gains right so that's the same thing right uh yeah so not sure right so there's double check it but yes if that's the case right that you don't have to pay any taxes then it makes sense that you sell everything that you own in India right now before moving to India yeah see actually it was told that Singapore does not have uh text on text on capital gains okay even UAE does not have it yeah but India and Singapore has a treaty called a double taxation award in treaty even UAE in India has it so that's what maybe the CA was telling me because of this reason if I am uh double taxation avoidance agreement means that you don't have to pay tax twice right but the problem in India is that India's a tax legon upside right I mean for example if it were the case that you are paying capital gains in India and capital gains in UAE then that is that falls under DTA right but what is happening is that you have to pay tax once somewhere but anyways this is a CA question so I'll yeah thank you thank you very good okay so I'll see you like in a few hours right I think two and half hours right so yep uh we'll meet then right but I hope you enjoyed this session and I'll see you soon right and okay okay all right so I'll see you in like a couple of hours okay
