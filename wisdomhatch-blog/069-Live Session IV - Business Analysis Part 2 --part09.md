SUMMARY:
The text is a fragmented discussion covering various topics related to investing, market trends, risk management, and real estate. Key points include advice on staying updated with market trends using tools like Google and AI aggregators, cautious investment strategies for Bitcoin, skepticism about fractional real estate in India due to black money issues, and insights into Dubai's growing economy and job market. The speaker emphasizes research, risk-reward analysis, and avoiding emotional decisions in investing.

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. **Staying Informed on Market Trends**:  
   - Use tools like Google, AI aggregators (e.g., ChatGPT), and platforms like Public.com for curated news summaries.  
   - Avoid traditional methods; focus on leveraging search engines and modern knowledge tools.  

2. **Bitcoin Investment Strategy**:  
   - Allocate ~5% of your portfolio to Bitcoin for exposure.  
   - Buy during corrections (e.g., 50-60% dips) but avoid overexposure.  
   - Track Bitcoin’s price movements closely and act quickly but avoid frequent trading unless extreme bullishness or psychological price levels (e.g., $100,000) are breached.  

3. **Market Caution and Risk Management**:  
   - Be wary of operator traps (dead cat bounces) in bearish markets; focus on risk-reward ratios.  
   - Prefer safer assets like large caps over small caps during volatile periods.  
   - SIP (Systematic Investment Plans) in India are resilient long-term, reducing extreme downside risks.  

4. **Real Estate and Fractional Ownership**:  
   - Avoid fractional real estate in India due to black money issues and inflated prices.  
   - Dubai/Singapore are better alternatives for fractional real estate due to transparent markets.  

5. **Mutual Fund Plans**:  
   - Convert regular mutual fund plans to direct plans by redeeming and reinvesting (no in-place conversion).  
   - Banks often complicate the process; contact AMCs (Asset Management Companies) directly.  

6. **Sector Rotation and Trends**:  
   - Predicting sector trends (e.g., autos, real estate) is speculative. Focus on fundamentals (e.g., consolidated private banks).  
   - No rigid rules for sector rotation; avoid seasonal or anecdotal theories.  

7. **Dubai’s Economy and Job Market**:  
   - Dubai is evolving into a "mini-America" with stricter but efficient systems (e.g., law enforcement).  
   - Skills for Dubai jobs: Unspecified, but adaptability and adherence to structured environments are implied as key.  

8. **General Investing Principles**:  
   - Research is critical; avoid emotional or herd-driven decisions.  
   - Partial profit-booking (e.g., 20-25%) in overvalued stocks hedges against downside risks.  
   - Focus on price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios rather than absolute price rises for valuation.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ht. Why unnecessarily take risk? No, what's the benefit? What's the upside? Right. Yeah. Thank you. But yeah, you're on snail. Yeah. Thank you. Upshed for your valuable insights and teaching throughout the course. I have two questions. Was what resources or habits do you suggest was being updated on market trend and making in form investment decision? Uninstalled Instagram. Right. So that's like the first thing. All really done. Right. So yeah, and use publicity. Great. Right. I mean, these two things work great. Yes. So other than that, it's not to see eyes. I mean, honestly, like you get a lot of meta information. Right. I mean, if you're using publicity or any like charge, GPT or whatever, right. I mean, you get they aggregate all the articles for you and give you like summary points. Then you learn how to read. Then you learn how to do research. So your job is to research things. Right. So yeah. So I mean, Google, public city, I think these are best. There is no one go to resource. Right. Cap money control, Palya, business, standard, Palya. That was an old way of learning. New way of learning is that learning like search engines and all that. I mean, that's where we are heading as a knowledge economy. And my second question is, it should be invested in Bitcoin through and some approach or by purchasing it at regular intervals. Okay. That's always a golden question. And so very hard for me to say, right. I mean, it really depends on what value are you getting things at? Right. If you're getting Bitcoin like 50%, 60% correction, then that's definitely a bulk by right now. It is a, you know, small bulk, right, not massive bulk. Right. For example, if you have to invest, that's a 10 units of money on Bitcoin. Right now, putting maybe like two is great. Right. Wait. Then see if consolidation is happening. Breakout is happening. Breakdown is happening. But Bitcoin moves really fast. So you need to keep tracking it. Right. And act quickly on it. Right. But have some Bitcoin exposure. Right. At least 5% of your portfolio should be Bitcoin. And what should we are failing up to? Right now, nothing. Let it get, let the asset class get mature. So right now, it's an aggregation stage. You don't book much profits on it. Nothing. Do nothing. Right. Unless it's completely like overvalued. Psychological levels. For example, 100,000 is a psychological level on Bitcoin. Right. It hit that and then it corrected, like 30, 35% so that was a psychological level approach. Sometimes there is extreme bullishness on Bitcoin. So then you sell it a little bit. But typically, you don't sell Bitcoin. Okay. Okay. Thank you so much. Thank you. Yeah. So Neil. Hi again. So, with the market recently, like doing a reverse and starting to I've been hearing a lot of my friends talk about, hey, it's an operator trap and you have to be very careful. We don't know what's going on because the world economy is still in a very like bearish phase. If India picks up like this, perhaps there is a play going on. So be very careful before deploying large capital. So I quite didn't understand this. How can operators play, like what is the whole thing about? Not very sure. See. Okay. So basically what happens is that what your friends are telling you is that a market is in a downturn. This is a dead cat bounce. A little bit jump has happened. And long-term it's bearish. So for example, if the channel in which we have drawn it keeps on going down, down, down, down, down, it's end of the market right in a way. So like now the thing is that whenever you're buying the market 15, 20% cheap in India, it's a little bit more than you know. Typically, unless there is a global crisis like 2008, 2020, all that stuff. So you always need to do your risk reward. That's more important, right? And just take two safer assets. For example, right now, am I buying any small caps? Should you buy large caps? Yes. Can large caps go down 10% from this? Yes. Then the market would have gone down 25% from top. So that's a bulk by zone. So you buy even more than, right? Will it securely go down over the next three years? No. Yes, that's very, very unlikely because that literally kills the SIP game in India, which is a booming game in India right now. Yes. That's how you need to think. Thank you. That's it. Yeah. Hi, Xit. Thanks for the session. Actually, we talked about budget finance. And we also said that we should not look at rise, but the price rise on English issue, P issues. And if you look at the P issue, even today, after such a high rise, it's still lower than the average one. So can I conclude that it means that there is some steam left still in budget finance? Okay. Good question. Right. So it is budget finance, right? Here's the P issue. Right. It's almost at sea. The baseline P 3536 is not as low P. Okay. For a company, which is at a size of 5.52 lakh crore. Now this P will be retained 35 P if the Bajaj finance keeps on growing at 20 30% CGR. The question is that will it grow at 20 30% CGR like at this baseline number, right? Because the base is too big. I don't know. So it's I don't have a clear answer. Yes. And all right. I mean, it's like in that confusion territory, always at the Navios, at the what will I do that if I'm if the stock price at an all-time I'll at least take off some profits, right? I'm not saying sell the entire Bajaj finance, but at least book like 20 25% profit. That gives you a hedge. For example, in case it falls, you can, the market is suffering like 30% US suffering 15. Okay. That's the joy of it. Yes. Thank you. We know the Fertuna. Yes. Okay. Thank you for the awesome sessions for the past two days. I have a tough question on building regular income, right? Yes. So you said real estate is a fantastic tool to build regular income, right? But then it comes with it today. A lot of hassle on finding the right client and then writing the rental agreements and this kind of stuff, right? So we have this kind of fractional real estate, which you know, the third party is doing this. Yes. So do you recommend this? In India, no. Why? Because they're crooks. Okay. So for example, in India, there's a lot of black money game. Okay. So for example, you'll buy fractional real estate from someone. Yoshi might have bought it at three gross. They will sell it to you at four gross. So they are already making their money there, right? So it's a problem and that is a structural problem in India's real estate market, the prevalence of black money. But if you're doing that, meaning Dubai, it's doable. So Dubai or like, you know, clear market, it's doable. Okay. I have another question also regarding this. I have built up now as you have invested in mutual funds. I also started investing in mutual funds initially. Now a lot of them are in regular plans. Now to convert them to direct plans, we need to redeem them and then convert. There's no other option. I think, right? I mean, as far as I know, there is no other option. You can put in an internal request with the AMC that if they can convert your direct to regular, I think that is also possible. I've never tried it because I've never bought like regular, like for such a long period of time. So I am not well versed with what the method right now is. But if you write to them, they will figure it out. I've persisted through banks. So always they will put in it. That's even worse because banks are not able to do it. Absolutely. Absolutely. So I want to immediately convert them to direct plans. Okay. I will try to the same CCC. Thank you. Okay. Alchana, yes. I want to know that how I came to know that the sector has changed before it happened. Whether it is auto-contour, or if it is going to finance or real estate, how I came to know. That which sector will be an opt-trend? Yeah. Which one will be an opt-trend? It's hard to pick. This is a guesswork. For example, because private sector banks or private sector banks has consolidated and it's fundamentally good, therefore the chances of an opt-trend is high. That's all you can say. Beyond that, there is no method or mathematics behind sector catching sector rotation. Is it no straight rule to the seasonal change of... Yeah. All that is yes. Okay. Don't believe in all that. Okay. Manth. Yeah. Hey, Akshad. Thank you for this great session so far. Just a couple of questions around Dubai thing. So one is, as you have been living in Dubai for a while now, so how much Dubai is far away from becoming a closed economy or a less accessible place like as compared to the Singapore out of now? Because there's a lot of discussion around Dubai being the next destination for job people, especially right. That is one. Second question would be, what are a couple of skills you think are really important if you're going from India to Dubai for a job considering in the next two to three years? So what are the upcoming skills in job market? Second, I don't know anything, right, because I don't do a job in Dubai, right. So I have no idea. Okay. So about second, first, I feel that Dubai will become like a mini-America. Okay. So they're exactly building Dubai like that in the sense that with harsher rules, okay. So it's like slightly more conservative, which is great, right, because that is a massive USB. They have figured out the system really well, right. System in the sense, for example, laws work. Okay. I feel safer talking to Dubai police compared to Indian police. Okay. So like, I say, like, and everyone like has great experiences like the way police and all that. Laws work. Okay. And there is people who are clean, people who want to follow rules they enjoy living in Dubai, right. That's not a problem for them. Right. Straight forward people. Right. So that kind of helps them. You don't create trouble for anyone. No one is going to create trouble for anyone. Right. So that is there. Right. So a lot of things are that right. So structurally they have made it secure, right. Aspirationally, Dub
