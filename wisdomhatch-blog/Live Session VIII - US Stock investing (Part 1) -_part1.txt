SUMMARY:
**  
The transcript is from a live session on US stock investing, focusing on key strategies for selling stocks, goal-based investing, and risk management. The speaker covers topics like trend-following techniques (e.g., simple moving averages), the Pareto principle (80/20 rule), and the importance of holding investments for at least three years to benefit from market trends. They also discuss when to exit fundamentally strong stocks (e.g., for critical financial goals), the risks of over-averaging down on individual stocks, and the challenges of sector rotation in modern markets. The session emphasizes personalized investing aligned with life goals and avoiding emotional decisions.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Selling Strategies:** Use trend-following techniques like simple moving averages (SMA) to time exits, avoiding attempts to time parabolic market falls (e.g., recessions).  
- **Goal-Based Investing:** Align stock investments with life goals (e.g., education, weddings); exit overvalued or fairly valued assets when funds are needed, but avoid selling undervalued holdings unless necessary.  
- **Time Horizon:** New investments should have a minimum 3-year window to capitalize on trends, capital rotation, and undervalued opportunities.  
- **Risk Management:** Limit losses by capping individual stock investments to 5% of capital; avoid "ego-driven" averaging down on failing stocks (exceptions: broad indices like Nifty 50).  
- **Sector Rotation Challenges:** Modern markets show uneven performance within sectors (e.g., private vs. public banks), making traditional rotation strategies less reliable.  
- **Mindset:** Accept market volatility as inevitable; focus on disciplined, goal-oriented investing rather than emotional reactions.  
- **Resource Mention:** A video on profiting during recessions was highlighted as supplemental material.

 Hi everyone, I hope you can see me, if yes, very quick thumbs up. Awesome, awesome. Alright, so more people are joining and I'll just wait for like a few seconds and then we will start. Okay. Alright. Okay, people are able to join in. Good evening, good evening everyone. Okay, awesome. Alright, so let's start guys and this is the final class. Right, so on this I will speak a little bit about three things. Right, so one is that I will just complete the selling part. Right, and I spoke about one of the most complicated yet profound techniques of selling in the last class. I'll not repeat it. That was simple moving averages technique. Okay. So that's trend following. That's what momentum means you would have heard about a lot of things like momentum, one to go to the scene and all that. And then they'll give you like some complicated strategy and all that. Cochriniyao. So right, I mean, all is this. Okay, I'll just tell you, save like one percent commission. Okay, so unlike any mutual fund. Right, so I mean, that's what they track. The new thing and right now, but honestly, like if you do do this, it's like 80 20 80 20 means that there is like a Pareto principle which says that. That 20% focused efforts generate 80% results. So in the stock market also, we need to act in the same manner. Okay, so this is one right I'll cover rest of the selling techniques quickly. Right, and then I will just have two three more points to cover. Then I'll highlight that right. So morning we studied these these specific points. Okay, now this side covered right that okay, 30% law should I sell no right. I see the market's falling soon should I sell now and reenter. So basically what are you trying to do? You're trying to write a trend. So again, I had explained this in the morning that you rather do this through SMA technique or channel trading technique. Right, that kind of makes more sense. You cannot prevent parabolic false right 2008 was a parabolic fault 2020 was a parabolic fall. You cannot cannot I am saying you again that here you will get hit. It's not about like and it's like saying that okay, I want to get into a boxing ring, but I don't want to take any punch. Okay, so that will not happen. Okay, you cannot like keep on making 15 20% returns consistently over like you know substantial period of time without going through a little bit of heartics. Okay, so this happens due to recession. What exactly is a recession. So I will release a video today. How to make money in a recession and you know, we are so like that's that's fun. Okay, so like just watch that it's an interesting video that I've done. So public video you can watch it. It will be released tonight. Okay, so this you cannot really time this is again a useless debate. Okay, went to exit good fundamentally consistent growth stocks. Okay, see it's not about exiting good fundamentally consistent growth stocks. Okay, so for example, just say nifty 50 right now it is fairly valued. I would not say that it is undervalued right now. Now nifty 50 is a fundamentally good asset. It is fairly valued. Okay, and let's say that you have been investing into nifty 50 let's say when you are like 20 years old. Okay, and now you're 40 now you started with you know, 5000 rupees now you run an SIP of one like group. Right, then overall your portfolio is like 50 60 likes. Okay, so that's a lot of money on nifty 50 you require that money. For example, let's say you know, wedding of son daughter sending them abroad. Doing bunch of different things. So this money is needed. Okay, now wherever you feel that the asset is overvalued or fairly valued. Okay, overvalued with a definitely legal job. For example, small cap mid caps are overvalued. So you withdraw money there first. Okay, second, if you require more money, then you withdraw money from fairly valued. Okay, undervalued you try not to sell it, but again, this is goal based investing. You are going you are investing for a goal. You started investing in like stock markets to meet certain life goals. That was a purpose of stock investing to begin with. So it's not as if that you should not pull out money if required. Right now, so it's not about that right. So for example, the goal is not like you know, invest forever and die. Okay, the goal is that you use that money also right. So if you need money, then you should definitely pull it out everything right from overvalued assets from fairly valued asset. So it's completely okay if those goals are critical. Okay, there is little bit of goal planning also. So goal planning simply means that see for example, let's say right now in 2025. Okay, nifty 50 is fairly valued. Okay, now what is the meaning of a fairly valued fairly valued means this is a good time to enter stock market also. And this is a good time to exit stock market also. Okay, and it depends on how much of your network is there on the stock markets. For example, someone who has 100% of their investments in real estate right now. Okay, they want to enter the stock market. So for them to 2025 is a great entry here. Okay, on the flip side, if someone is 100% stock investor. Okay, and they have like critical things coming up. For example, daughters wedding have to study abroad, have to pay MBA tuition for ISV, all that stuff. It's a great time for them to exit some of the stocks like I mean nifty 50 also a bit. Okay, so this has to do with goals. These are extremely personalized. I cannot comment on that. Okay, but again, the yard stick is that whenever you are putting money for example, whatever new money you are bringing to the stock market today in 2025. It should at least have a three year time span. Okay, associated with it. Okay, so for example, when you book an FD, you at least hold it for a year or whatever, like you know, commitment you have made. Okay, so therefore you are putting it there. Right. So similarly, if you are putting money in stock markets, then again, you are making a commitment that you will hold it for three years. So say, first, if opportunities there and all that stuff create, okay, but today, whatever new money was throwing here, okay. It has to be done for a three year basis. Okay, everyone with me. Now why three year basis because it allows you to write the trend for three years. Okay, or like some part of that three year. It allows you to capital rotate. Okay, it allows you to buy something which is undervalued, invest, take money out of overvalued, rotate capital, all that stuff. Okay, so you can only, you will only benefit from the stock market if you at least have a three year window. Okay, now I'm not saying that buy and forget for three years. All I'm saying is that hey, you're investing like one lakh rupees today. At least you need to give it three years from a portfolio planning perspective for it to take ship. Okay, so it's like not saying that you know what I want to eat mango like I'm in. I'll plant seed today and tomorrow I want to eat fruit. No, no, no, no. Okay, so similarly, this is a situation here. Okay, all right, went to exit good fundamentally consistent growth companies. The answer probably is never. Okay, you should book partial profits. If you require money, then you withdraw it. Otherwise, there is no sense to exiting it. Limit to downward averaging, right? So many people say that he know what? Akshat, I bought like geo finance. At let's say 100 unit page up stock price. Okay, then it fell to 70 units. Okay, I bought more. Okay, then it fell to 50 units. Then I bought more. Okay, then I fell to 30 units. Then I bought more and then it went to zero. Okay, so like that can also have to do. Okay, so so what is happening here? You have made it and ego game. Okay, now what is the ego game? Ego game simply means that's because I'm having a loss of 30% on geo finance. I need to do all my lost recovery from this. Okay, then it falls by another 30% then you invest even more. Then it falls by another 30% then you invest even more. Okay, the point is when should you stop? Whenever you have invested 5% of your capital on an individual asset, you stop. You stop being a gambler. There are things beyond our scope of analysis, which we might not be able to see. So just leave it and does this rule apply on index? No, indexes are fine. For example, nifty 50 if you if it falls well like 30% then you invest 35% then you invest more. That is fine, right? Because index going to zero the chances are very less unless the Indian economy collapses. Okay, now when will Indian now if Indian economy collapses let's assume that you have gotten out of nifty 50. You will put it in a bank. Have you know, so GDP going to zero means what? Right, even your bank deposit will go to zero. So everything will go to zero. So on that note, there is no benefit of like sort of not a downward averaging index. Okay, everyone gets this. Okay, now many people want to sector rotate. People ask me that they tell me like three indicators where I can sector rotate all that. See, this used to be easy in the past that okay, consumer durables. Right, then here it will get overvalued. Then people will pull out money. Then it will go to banks. Then it will they will pull out money. Then you know bank ran up over here. And then it will move to FMCG. This used to happen in the past. Okay, now what is happening is that for example, even within banks. For example, you would have seen that private banks last four years. Nothing, right, not much returns. Okay, public banks, for example, PNB went from 35 rupees all the way till 120 rupees. Okay, which was crazy. Okay, so public banks give her enough small finance banks give one round of run up. Then they corrected a lot. Now they might give another round of run up. So what I'm telling you is that the bank in itself has sever
