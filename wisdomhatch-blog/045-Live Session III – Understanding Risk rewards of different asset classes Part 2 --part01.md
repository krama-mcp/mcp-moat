SUMMARY:
**  
The transcript discusses the dynamics between Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) and Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) in the Indian stock market, explaining how their interactions influence market stability. It highlights instances of "parabolic falls" (sharp declines) when FIIs sell heavily without corresponding DII buying, as seen in events like the 2008 crash and 2020 market drop. The speaker notes that markets are "managed" to ensure liquidity and attract foreign investment, citing examples like RBI-imposed limits on mutual funds investing abroad to protect the INR. The discussion also touches on the role of government policies, liquidity mechanisms like order book matching, and the importance of keeping foreign investors satisfied to maintain India's economic growth.

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Market Liquidity & Parabolic Falls:** A sharp market decline occurs when FIIs sell aggressively without proportional DII buying, creating a high outflow-to-inflow imbalance (e.g., 2020 crash).  
- **Managed Markets:** The Indian stock market is influenced by institutional and governmental actions (e.g., RBI restricting mutual fund outflows to stabilize the INR).  
- **Foreign Investment Dependence:** India prioritizes foreign capital (e.g., favorable NRI deposit terms) to strengthen the INR and sustain economic growth.  
- **Order Book Matching:** Transactions require matching buyers and sellers; liquidity crises can arise if large sell orders lack counter-buyers (e.g., Warren Buffett exiting Indian stocks).  
- **Policy-Driven Incentives:** Government and RBI policies (e.g., tax advantages for NRIs) reflect efforts to attract and retain foreign investment.  
- **Investor Implications:** Understanding these dynamics can help investors anticipate market movements and align strategies with institutional behaviors.

 foreign buffet, hedge funds, all that stuff. So just give me a second. I don't know, like so many ads popping up. Yes, I want to close the ad. I would go close the ad. There's too many ads, man. So. OK, so whenever you see a very sharp for example, let's go and study like. If I as are exiting and di is are buying for the last five months, you're seeing, OK, this is not a parabolic fall parabolic fall. Typically happens around like 2000 credit the data for the last five months. What you'll notice is this right. So for example, here last five months, if he see red, green, red, green, red, green, red, green, that 20 2008 types, OK, for example, you know, maybe you are not right. So for example, 2020 if you go right. So this is again, here the market was handled right. So even in 20 despite parabolic fall, like, you know, when this was the case, right. So here for example, this was both the party selling no one buying, no one buying, right, no one buying, right, net selling, net selling, net selling, OK. So here, for example, why did parabolic fall happens? They just keep on showing ads one. How do I remove these ads? I don't know. So anyways, let me see. OK, so anyways, let me come here. Basically, what's happened here was that in 2020, right. For example, this fall. What you would notice here is that FIs, for example, sold 6,000 crores, right. And DIAs did not buy and bought like 500 crores. Yeah, only right. There is a huge delta between these two in percentage terms. OK, so it's rate at which money is getting out that creates parabolic fall. Everyone understands. OK, for example, if FIs sell 50,000 crore, but DIA is by 49,000 crores, this is a 1000 crore difference on a percentage basis of outflow to inflow. The percentage will be very less understood compared to this something like this. OK, here the percentage of outflow is very high. So this parabolic fall happens due to instances like these. OK, where FIs see DIAs, anyways, will buy the Indian market. Why? Because they cannot invest anywhere else. For example, when you are investing in quant mutual fund large caps, schemes in India, can they invest in Chinese stocks? The quant guys. They can't. The mandate of that mutual fund is Indian stocks unless they are specifically launching a global fund. Right. Recently, a lot of mutual funds, for example, a lot of people started investing in the US stock market and then mutual fund guys came and said that boss, we can't take your money. OK, they stopped taking a IP money, right? You can actually search that how many schemes stopped taking money for US investing. Right. So you can ask for complexity this question again, like wonderful tool. Right. You can literally like, you know, save a lot of time. So, mutual funds, just simply us, which mutual funds mutual funds stopped taking the IP for international investments in India. Right. So, for example, SBI mutual fund, 2025, right? right. Edelweiss, they all stopped somewhere around, like, December, again, like January February, right? Why did this happen? It is because of RB element, OK? So, then level two question, why did RBIP put limit? Because INR was getting weekend. Now when you give money to Motila Lozwal mutual fund, it becomes a vehicle for you for INR to get converted into USD which weekends are currency further and reduces our forex reserve and INR falls even more. Then third level question, who instructed RBI to institute this move? The government, okay. So here's the change, right? That government tells RBI to do something, right? The government tells RBI to do something, RBI tells mutual funds to do something and mutual funds make the clients pick, okay. For example, if you would have invested money in like January, February, all that stuff, you would have been in net profit in US stocks, okay. But you are unable to do it because this entire mandate was driven. That's case study one, case study two is that if you check FIIDI, buying selling data, whatever FII is selling, DII is will typically buy, okay. Imagine a circumstance that FII is also sell and DII is also sell. What do you think will happen? Like, one guy is selling 5,000 crore, another guy is selling for 3,000 crore. What do you think will happen in such a scenario? There will be a parabolic drop in the market, okay. So that's the entire story that I was leading to. So and what will happen if there is a parabolic drop in the market? There will be in a month, time, month and a half, time you will see like a 30, 40% correction, okay. So then comes the final question from my side that do you think that markets are independent or markets are managed? And what is the meaning of markets being managed, okay. It's 100% managed, okay. So that's the bottom line, okay. Otherwise there is no rationale why one big investor will be selling and another big investor will be buying, okay. Now who controls it and why do they control it? Because if you understand the incentive, you can possibly learn techniques to benefit from it, okay. See, it's a good thing that the markets are managed because then it means that your investment is safe because there are more vested interests at play, okay. For example, why am I happy buying like real estate in India, land, especially because I, because land is managed or land policies are managed by politicians. Politicians, judges, they are like that. So I know that property tax in India will be forever low, okay. Because the property tax in India is jacked up like in European countries, who will pay the most tax politicians, okay. It becomes a problem for them. So rather than making me, because I know this, therefore I'm okay buying like, you know, properties in India, okay. Now, if you understand these tricks about Indian stock market also, you'll understand, okay. So what happens here is like now, this is like both in a way dirty, right. And add the same time required, okay. So for that, let me help you understand the concept of order book matching, okay. So for example, if you check a look at this snippet, okay. What you will see is that someone is selling ITC stock, one order, right. And this order is getting matched and someone is buying ITC stock at 263.1, okay. Someone wanted to sell this stock and someone is buying this stock and zero the acts as a matchmaker between the two, okay. Then someone is selling 10, sorry, someone is selling three units at 263. And someone is buying at 263, 10 units, okay. Then 16 and 20. So this process of connecting sellers with buyers is called as order book matching, okay. Important point being that for example, if you look at it at a market level and let's work with the example, right. That for example, 500 crores of 5000 crores of Kotech Mahindra bank stock needs to be sold on 24th March, okay. And Warren Buffett wants to sell this stock. He's a seller. Unless he gets a counter buyer, right. Will he be able to sell it? No, right. For you to sell your house, someone needs to buy the house. That's the most important bit, okay. Someone for Warren Buffett to sell like, you know, 20 billion dollars of Apple stock, someone needs to buy that 20 billion dollars of Apple stock that day. For someone to buy Indian equities worth, you know, 35,000 crore in a month, someone has to buy that Indian equity for 35,000 crore that month. So who is the buyer and who is the buyer here, right. If FIIs want to sell. DIA, who is DIA? So DIR, HDFC, MC, want mutual fund, LIC, etc. Now what is LIC? Or quantum mutual fund? It's you guys doing your SIPs, okay. So like, you know, you are giving exit to FIIs anyway, okay. So that's the bottom line, okay. So that's the entire game, right. That someone needs to give them the option of exiting it. Now, okay. So I have spoken negatively. Now let me speak positively. Now let's imagine a scenario where FIIs can't exit. Warren Buffett wants to exit. Sell 10,000 crore of Indian equity. And he's unable to do it, okay. His money is getting stuck for like 20 days. No, there is no counter buyer, okay. There is no order book matching that is happening. What do you think Warren Buffett will do? They won't come to India. So therefore one could argue that, okay, these DIAs are also required, okay. And they have to manage the market. They have to give liquidity, right. Otherwise, what happens is it kills the golden world or golden hen, okay. And that okay, fine. Stock market, great place for Warren Buffett to come. All that stuff. He can sell cheap. Then he will take a loss. He will again never come to the Indian market. So the point being that you have to make foreign us or foreign investors very happy, okay. Why? For example, I'll give you another example at my level. For example, you guys do FDs at HDFC, bank at 7%. Seven percent, you pay 30% tax, you make net 5%. Okay. This is the net return that you're getting in INR terms, okay. And INR falls to US dollar by 4% a year or 3% a year. So your net return is 2% correct with me, math. Now if I as a NRI, give my money through FC and our account to HDFC bank, same bank. Guess the interest rate that they are paying me. It's 5.5%. Okay. So I will make 5.5% and guess how much tax I'm paying? Zero, okay. And that return I'm making in what? Dollars, okay. So I am getting 5.5% in dollar terms net. As an Indian resident, same money that I was giving to HDFC bank up until now, I would have made 2% net in dollar returns. The point is that getting foreign wealth into India is critical for India, okay. That's the game, right. So therefore they can't make NRIs unhappy and Indian government can't make an NRIs unhappy because they are limiting money back to India, it's strengthening the INR. That's one of the biggest exports that India has. Similarly, they India can't upset for an institutional investor
