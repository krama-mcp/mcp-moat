SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses investment strategies, emphasizing a long-term horizon (2-3 years) and focusing on simple indicators like the "cup with handle" pattern and SMAs (Simple Moving Averages). They stress avoiding overcomplication, especially for beginners, and differentiate between investing (long-term) and trading (short-term). Key advice includes:  
- Building positions in indices like Nifty 50 and private bank ETFs, with specific allocation recommendations (e.g., 60% in Nifty 50, 90% in private bank index if undervalued).  
- Rejecting a "buy and forget" approach, even for indices, and advocating periodic review.  
- Addressing practical questions: NRI tax implications (12.5% on India-denominated equity), capital movement rules (up to $1M without TCS for NRIs), and alternatives to savings accounts (e.g., arbitrage funds).

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Time Horizon Matters**: The course is designed for 2–3-year investors; short-term trading requires different strategies.  
- **Simplicity Wins**: Avoid overly complex indicators; stick to foundational tools like SMAs and chart patterns.  
- **Index Investing**: Nifty 50 and private bank indices are recommended for beginners, with specific allocation guidance (e.g., 50–60% in Nifty 50, 30% max in sector-specific ETFs).  
- **Active Monitoring**: Even "safe" index investments need periodic review—compare to visiting a property you own.  
- **NRI Considerations**: India-originated equity gains taxed at 12.5%; up to $1M can be moved tax-free via NRE/NRO accounts.  
- **Risk Management**: Hold reserves (e.g., 20% cash) for downward market movements.  
- **Alternatives to Savings**: Arbitrage funds may offer better returns but require clarity on liquidity needs.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 one year basis. Okay. So now for us, we have to number one define our time horizon. So I have categorically said, in my day of halto kata in the air, I can when I bet look at like five, five minute candle and all that, we have a work to do right. I mean, we have like other things going on in our life. Right. So we pick our investment system where we can. We have first and foremost, we create a viewpoint that whatever money we are bringing to the market. It's at least for two to three years. So this course is entirely designed around that. So therefore, the only indicators that I'm teaching you is like, you know, for example, cup with handle pattern, I'll talk about a little bit. What do fall I've already spoken about? SMA I have already spoken about. Is it beyond NIT? Yes, but that will create like conflicting image and you will get confused. So it will do more harm than good. Okay. So there is no point in you learning. You don't really need to learn. If you are a two to three year investor, if you say that he and what I'm like a positional trader, we'll deal with trading. It's a cow. I'm not the right guy number one. Right. So then learning whatever you are saying kind of makes more sense. Okay. So. Oh, shiqa. Yeah. Yeah, guys. So class is done. Right. I'll see you guys in the. Evening. Right. And in case you want to leave it's fine to not issue. I hope this was insightful. This was a little bit complicated. Right. What I taught today, but hopefully you're getting a hang of it. Right. So we'll cover like rest of the selling and US investing in the evening. Okay. Happy word. Shikha. Yes. Quite. Yeah. Two questions. One, if I want to be a buy and forget kind of investor, but if I have to move to indices in the state and start building positions, they're going forward, what is the percentage in which I should distribute my capital across indices, which indices. That's question one. And question two is how do you distinguish between our resistance and a breakout? Okay. So let me explain resistance and a breakout in the evening or on some post. Okay. That's one second is that I'd already explained which indices you can pick as a beginner. Right. So there was seven eight. Right. So for example, mid cap 150, nifty 50, NASDAQ, which is QQQ. I'll give some US index names in the evening. So XXXXX. So that we will do in the evening. Right. But I'd already like if you revise the class, I'd explain those seven eight indices. Right. So just that should be good enough. Right. There is no buy and forget even on index. So but like index is the safest place to do buy and forget. But it's not as if that, you know, pay Sala Agaj, it's hot, the Akavi Deikan, it's like you buying a property and never going in visiting it. It's called, it's not called investing, it's called stupidity. Okay. So like don't do that ever. Right. Even when you buy a flat, at least go and visit it once. Okay. So that's an important point. So yeah, say that. Yeah. Just two questions. First of all, for the nifty 50, I think you said it's barely price. So if I look at a five year and a three year trend, it's roughly around 15, 16% return something which I checked in the trend lines. So currently it's fairly price. So I've not invested in index. So how much should I start with right now? Because it's in a downtrend. But as you said, it is in the downtrend also, it is at the high, high, I mean, upper high, something like that. So what, how much should you invest right now? So I'm just saying, see, on a three to five year basis, if you are doing three years basis, and it's a good time to start investing in nifty 50, right? And you should build like at least 60% position right now, 50, 60% of courage, hold though, then leave room for at least like 20% down, down 20% downward aperture. And same applies for the nifty private bank index you mentioned. Yes, you have true similar analysis. Nifty private bank index is undervalued. So I would pick like at least 90% position on nifty private banks now. Right now. Yeah. And you suggest again, in both roughly around 5% of the portfolio. No, no. So the hell you can pick bigger, right? So for example, nifty 50, even if you put 100% of your capital in nifty 50, it's fine, right? That's not because it's already a collection of 50 stocks. It's not individual stock that you're buying. Private bank ETF if you're buying that it should not be more than like maybe 30% of your portfolio. Because you know, currently I've been only doing mutual funds which I'll gradually stock because you know, that's how everyone has been doing. So I want to start building positions on one is indexes as you mentioned. And second is individual stocks. So I thought I'll start with indexes right now and then maybe gradually learn and do the. So you're seeing around 5 to 10% of indexes fine. And these index are good nifty 50 and bank private. As of yes. Yeah. Thanks. Thanks. Okay. So may you as I ask me a question, I'll just quickly take some questions on the chart and come back. Right. Hey, except you have sun, you are you're building portfolio for your sun. Can you share investments? Study whatever. I just want to know your approach to this nifty factors. See, I mean, honestly, like good investing is good investing. Whether I do it for me, I do it for my kids. It doesn't matter. So good habits are good habits. Whether you do it for yourself or your kids, it's fun and the same thing. That's how I see there is no special like skill required for your kids. Right. Now, I do it exactly the same way. I'll do it for myself. Okay. So, uh, users buy high quality assets and buy it at the right price. It sounds boring that I'm saying the same thing over and over again. Right. But I've shown you like enough examples that it works. Okay. So nifty 50 is a high quality asset. Are you getting it at the right price right now? I would say yes. Right at a decent price. Okay. Does it mean that you invest 100%? No. Like you invest maybe 7089 now if you're new and you wait for a trend reversal whenever up to 10 happens and ride that trend, then we will make money. Okay. Money will not be made in like next three four days because number one, you will buy it. Right. It's like buying a land. Okay. If you buy a land and you build a house on it, then you do interiors on it and then you sell it, you will get the maximum value. But if you just buy the land and flip the land like day after tomorrow, will you will your price go up like crazy? Typically not. Try to same happens on stock markets that you first enter well, then you wait a little bit for 10 reverse and then you wait like, you know, let the plant grow like let up trend happen, let people run and you know, create like, you know, noise, you know, stock market, the way you go. Right. So let them like buy more, let them give you exit on cook on the side, we are feel good. Right. So let them do it. Then finally, you sell your stocks. Okay. So when things look over value and you know, reprimands that's how it's okay. Sorry. Priyana, yes, good. I actually had two questions. One, I wanted to understand about the tax implications for an NRI Demat account like something I need to like just overall. Okay. I will send a note. My team had already prepared it. Right. So I'll see if I can find that one. I'll send it to you. Right. But the taxation is fairly simple. I mean, you have to pay tax on 12.5% on your India originated equity investments. So that has to be done. India, India denominated assets, you have to pay like same LTCG, STCG, okay, except for like FDs, which you do through your NRE, you have to pay taxes. So if I now open a new NRI or Demat account on that whatever the turns I get is a 12.5. Yes. Is what you're saying? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Okay. The other thing was about moving money like we were actually I have certain capital in India, which you know, if we are planning to invest in real estate in the by and we are looking at distress sales in that case, we need the capital like ready in hand and which means like moving a chunk in a go. So I just thought that are there any insights from this? Now, you can move up to if you are an NRI, then you can move, then you open an NRI NRI account and through your, then you can transfer up to a million dollars. So that's not a problem and you don't have to pay any TCS on it. So it's all amount will come in here. Yeah. Three of tax, yeah. Yes. Up to a million. Yeah. Okay. Okay. In to an NRI account or sorry, NRI account. Yes. So you have to first convert your savings into NRI slash NRI account and then you bring that money to like your whatever like to buy Singapore based accounts, right? And you don't have to pay any TCS on that because that's the rule. Right. So up to a million dollars, you will not call under LRS now. Right. So because you are in NRI. So you can transfer up to a million dollars if you have an NRI slash NRI account. Okay. Thank you so much. Okay. So please make WhatsApp group where we know so no interest right in making all these things because you will get scammed or someone then you'll say, except for a course, scam, okay, I said right. So no, like and then some people will start sending like a good morning message and rose with things. So so you're correct. So like I don't want to waste people's time. So right. Rajesh. Yes, quite. No, you have to unmute yourself, Rajesh. Yeah. Yeah. Hi. Thanks for the opportunity action. I just would like to know. The arbitrage fund can we use it instead of keeping the money in the saving accounts? See, it depends. I mean, so honestly like be clear about why you're investing or putting money somewhere. Okay. So for example, if you're putting money in Dubai real estate, assume it will not grow in value. It's a great excellent cash flow. If that makes you happy, invest. Okay. Similarly, if you're putting your money, keeping your money in FD slash savings account, it's opportunity money, which is easily accessible to you. So for ex
