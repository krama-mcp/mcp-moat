SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses the inefficiency of relying on dividends from stocks for retirement income due to double taxation (once at the corporate level and again at the individual level) in India. It contrasts this with assets like gold and real estate, which historically protect wealth better than cash. The author also highlights the impact of currency depreciation (e.g., INR vs. USD/Dirham) on purchasing power, especially for NRIs investing in Indian real estate. The text emphasizes tax optimization strategies for real estate and briefly touches on cryptocurrency volatility.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Dividends are tax-inefficient in India**: They are taxed twice (corporate profits and individual income), making stocks a poor choice for passive income.  
- **Wealth protection varies by asset class**: Gold preserves purchasing power long-term, while cash (like historical â‚¹20) loses value due to inflation.  
- **Currency depreciation matters**: A weaker INR increases costs for expenses in foreign currencies (e.g., education, property abroad) and advantages NRIs buying Indian assets.  
- **Real estate can be tax-efficient**: Structuring ownership via companies (lower corporate tax rates) optimizes tax burdens compared to personal rental income.  
- **Global competition for assets**: NRIs dominate high-value property purchases in India due to access to "white money" and currency advantages.  
- **Cryptocurrencies are volatile**: While they offer growth potential, their unpredictability makes them risky for stable retirement income.  
- **Tax planning is critical**: Legal loopholes (e.g., real estate management companies) can significantly reduce tax liabilities.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
parents want to retire and they need regular income what should they do can we do it in the stock market no you can't do it in the stock market you'll say dividends now dividends are horribly tax inefficient because dividends are taxed twice right how twice one in the hand of the company for example how do companies give dividends right so for example if you go here right and go on screener right so for example here and if you take a look at ITC then ITC is very dividend that is very dividend that is okay now where do dividends come from now dividends come from these profits okay so for example if ITC is in the year 2024 has generated 20,751 crores what it will do is 20,751 crores what what options does it have number one option is that it reinvests these profits okay that they go and build like 20 other factories 1000 crores or option two is that they redistribute this profit okay now when they redistribute this profit this is given to stockholders so for example if you own one stock of ITC and there are only 100 stocks of ITC that are there then you get a dibs on like you know divide this by 100 and this is the amount of dividend that you could get if the company is redistributing it but before this redistribution happens the company is taxed by whom by the government okay so this is one and when you get the dividend you are taxed again on the dividend at slab okay so you are taxed twice so buying stocks for dividend is stupidity at scale okay so never buy stocks for dividend it makes no sense then you'll say that okay if the company is not ready because see if ITC were to just redeploy that capital and create 20 new factories it will reflect into the stock price okay so the stock price itself will go up it's not as if that that money is like you know gone somewhere in thin air okay everyone understands we'll study this subsequently but the point is that there are certain things for example but the point is that there are certain things for example from a tax efficiency perspective if you consider dividends on this this is useless okay in India at least okay now in some countries dividend is not taxed for example in UA dividend is not taxed so there it might make sense to plan your portfolio through stocks for dividends in Singapore dividends are capital gains is not there I don't think even dividends are there so no such problem occurs there okay so I hope this point is clear to everyone okay what about real estate can it protect your wealth which means so which brings us to a very fascinating story right of grandfathers okay for example right you know Gurpreet's grandfather right was smart right and he had like 10 grams of gold and he logged it in his locker okay in 1900s okay or something right and back then you can buy like with 10 grams of gold one cow okay now Gurpreet discovered it in 2025 that my grandfather left like 10 grams of gold can he still buy that one cow with that 10 gram of gold so what answer is he can okay because the gold price went up like crazy since 1900 to now my grandfather like let's say hypothetically right he had 10 grams of gold he decided that you know what I don't want that I'll get like 10 to pee of 15 to pee or 20 to pee note okay so you got like 20 to pee note he left it for me I discovered it in 2025 okay what can I do it 20 to pee I can't even possibly buy dairy milk with it okay so that's called it's wealth demolition okay so Gurpreet's grandfather protected his wealth okay so some assets protect wealth and some asset classes destroy wealth okay and this has to do with the buying power now I'll say he may have a part of the book pass right so you it impacts you a lot why because you are you have almost close to or almost 90 percent of you would have 100 percent exposure to iron r okay now just to scare you a little bit right if you just simply go okay okay so if we go right and if we just quickly check here right uh usd to iron r chart now back in 2014 I went to Singapore in Seattle okay so back then iron r was 60 rupees right now it is at 86 rupees now do you think that in Seattle is brought down their fees no they used to charge like whatever like 100,000 USD back then now how much are they charging now 120,000 right buddy you you you you and on top of that how much iron r depreciation has happened to me so 60 by 26 so 26 by 60 is like almost what 45 percent right so 45 percent additional fees I have to pay for in Seattle now I'll say that hey you know what I don't want to send my kids so number one most of you look young so you don't even know like you know where your kids would want to go right but they will definitely blame you if you are unable to send them right so like you know it kind of makes sense for you to worry about this from now okay that's fun uh second key thing is that's even if you are living in India it impacts you how exactly on per square foot basis Mumbai real estate is more expensive than Dubai real estate I'm not talking about Charger real estate as one real estate this that stuff I am talking about prime business-based property you can buy cheaper in Dubai right now then buying it in okay and it will give you like net cash flow better than Mumbai okay so that's one right I don't like where people are buying like you know properties in Mumbai now why is that happening right and what sends it to their make that's a very interesting like topic of discussion which we can talk for like one hour but I'll not waste so much time right but see what is happening yes that in India high ticket properties are mostly being bought by people who save in foreign currencies right so for example I right now I am technically now saving in dirhams okay now for me right I mean when I moved to UA and back then one dirhams was 22.5 now it is at 24 so one and a half times almost four five so that is almost six seven percent appreciation on dirhams so for me to buy so buy a property now in Mumbai has become 10% cheaper did you guys understand how okay because I'm saving in dirhams right now similarly if you're in if you're working with Google Microsoft in the US you are saving in US dollars okay again it has become cheaper for you 10% right but for a person living in India in Mumbai who has the aspiration of buying the same house has property become more expensive for you or cheaper for you it has become more expensive for you because your competition is someone else okay for that same house for example if 10% fall has happened in I and R mirita buddy I know right I mean I'll buy like now you know I'll just simply convert that dirhams by it here right so that's that's an option for me so even if you feel that you know what boss I am setting in India this I and R fold does not matter to me it does matter to you a lot okay why because the race of asset acquisition is a global race NRI is by crazy properties in India right almost come to go right almost 78% new properties that are getting sold are being bought by NRIs or daily Mumbai black money eyes okay that's all what is happening right so almost 78% properties okay and what ends up happening is that many of the goons actually live in Portugal or are like not sending their kids abroad they require a lot of money in white so NRI has become the number one category who are buying property in India because the seller property in goa because the seller wants money in white and only NRIs have white money right so just for example just you pocket right I mean you could not buy a property in like goa despite having 16 crores of wealth why because I want money in like one crore white give me one crore white right so now you cannot give it okay so that's the problem okay so I hope that this point is clear and you got the concept of wealth protection okay now quickly completing this entire exercise see here you need to think about it at multiple levels for example if you go to go to the equation around LT CG now is stock tax efficient from an efficiency basis yes it is okay so this is not like problematic right now what about wealth protection on real estate does it protect wealth good quality real estate protects us yeah so this is there right and what about tax efficiency on real estate now people who know how to deal with real estate will say yes people who do not have any understanding of it will say no it's worst okay and I can tell you 10 different ways of saving like taxes on real estate I'm like half a CNO okay so like like so what's simple here so see in India what ends up happening is that if you are commanding rent you will have to pay a slab almost because it becomes your operating income so in India personal income tax is very high so for example if you buy a flat and you have put it up on rent and you're collecting hypothetically all money and white you have to pay highest degree of tax that you are exposed to everyone with me on the flip side let's say someone like me who owns like let's say 10 properties what will I do I'll create a real estate management company now that becomes corporate income now in India corporate income is lower than personal income okay am I doing some pop no that's what tax tells me I'm learned about it I'm like you know exploiting that loophole right so it's not as if that I'm doing some pop right so for example hf right so for example hf many of us can't register so register it no it was a big deal right so these are all like legal ways of saving taxes so real estate can be a high tax game or a low tax game depending on how you're optimizing it so this is this really depends on your personal planning right so to say okay so this is what I would say now what about cryptos right so if you have to just quickly fill it now can stocks grow your well that more than like 12% because we are assuming baseline inflation for us at at this yes liquidity absolutely yes if you want money tomorrow you can get money tomorrow or the after okay volatility yes I okay so this is a negative part so I'll jus
