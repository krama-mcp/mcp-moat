SUMMARY:
**  
The transcript discusses a business analysis session focusing on evaluating industries and companies for investment. Key points include analyzing industry growth rates (e.g., solar energy at 13.4% CAGR) and value migration (e.g., from PSU banks to private banks like HDFC/ICICI). The speaker emphasizes avoiding stagnant industries and highlights the importance of growth potential (e.g., Zomato’s expansion into quick commerce). A case study on CDSL illustrates assessing valuation metrics (P/E ratios, growth rates) to determine if a stock is over/undervalued. The session underscores a top-down approach, combining growth trends and value migration for informed investment decisions.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Industry Growth Rate:** Prioritize fast-growing industries (e.g., solar, fintech) over stagnant ones.  
- **Value Migration:** Identify shifts in value (e.g., from PSU banks to private banks) to spot outperforming sectors.  
- **Case Study – Zomato:** Assess future value migration (e.g., expansion into 10-minute delivery) to gauge long-term potential.  
- **Valuation Metrics:** Use P/E ratios, revenue/profit growth (e.g., CDSL’s 11X stock rise vs. 3X profit growth) to avoid overvalued stocks.  
- **Monopoly & Growth:** Monopoly-like businesses (e.g., CDSL) may justify higher P/E if growth rates (e.g., 30% CAGR) are sustainable.  
- **Top-Down Approach:** Combine growth trends and value migration for holistic investment analysis.  
- **Economic Context:** Benchmark company growth against broader economy (e.g., India’s ~6-7% GDP growth).

==================================================

 Yeah, etc. And there is a reason why most of our industry will grow because we are an emerging economy. Okay. So our size of finance, right banks are growing in India. No, no problem. Okay. Tech one could argue is growing in India. Like Zomato Swiggy is growing in an economy is like what four trillion dollars or something like China is like 18 trillion dollars. So China can comparison may be like one fifth. Okay. So that's so therefore like I mean we are growing from a smaller base. Okay. But the sign of a good industry or the first key thing that you need to understand is that is it a good industry? For example, many of you get excited to be solar menvest. Okay. Now is the solar. solar industry. Growth rate in India just type and see. Okay. Yeah. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. When the solar energy market has projected to grow at a C a G R of 13.4. Okay. Now this is good right. So this could be one of your industries that you could consider. Now I'm not giving it a pass. Okay. This is like literally like first filter that we are looking at. Okay. It's not like okay. Growth rate in the industries. I so you buy it. Now why because these are these also come with their own risk. For example, when we are looking at solar industry, they are very high capital intensive industry to make this 13.4% growth rate. Right. How expand their business or grow at this rate. You have to invest a lot of capital. Okay. But banks might grow without investing that much capital or FinTech firms might grow without investing a lot of capital. But here, the first key point that you need to understand is that please don't grow. Please don't go to industries which are not growing at a fast scale. Okay. This is one. Second key aspect is value migration. Now value migration means that where is value moving? Okay. For example, if you consider PSU banks in the 90s. Right. Now basically they held like almost 100% of the banking business. Okay. 890s or early 2000s private sector banks came. So where did the value migrate from from here to here? And therefore something like HDFC, ICIC, I have bank etc have outperformed stocks like SBI and all that. Okay. So you got the concept of value migration. Now where is now for example, if we consider IT industry. Now will value come into this industry or the chances of value going out of this industry high. Now that's a point for further discussion. But this value migration concept is very important from that lens. Okay. For example, if you consider a Zomato. Okay. Many people will think that you know there is no value or more this company has. Right. Now someone wrote a Twitter post also. He's a matter of a Sakeya mode. I mean, or you just have to like get drivers and all that. The point is that they have like 8 million drivers right on their platform, which is crazy. Right. So that itself is a mode. Okay. Now. Do you think that people are going to order more food in the future, right. Setting or setting at home or people will become very health conscious and not order food, right. etc. So is value going to migrate to Zomato or not? Right. That's the question if you're trying to answer. Then you have to think of this value migration thing. What does Zomato started doing recently? Right. So now this is an entirely new industry, right, which is a risk and which Zomato has opened up. They started like 10 minute delivery, right. Two years ago. That has become like really big, right. So value migrated more towards things like Zomato. Now if you are in UA, you would have heard of like an app called as noon, right. So noon app delivers what? It delivers pretty much everything. So Zomato can start competing with Amazon also correct. If they want to, right. For example, 10 minute delivery up laptop, 3 than I go right now the chances of value migration into Zomato is higher or chances of value migration out of Zomato is higher. I would say into Zomato is higher, right. So this passes like the first key test, right. So this is how you would analyze or do like a top down approach every year with me. Okay. And if you do these two things, think about it from a growth rate perspective. And second from a value migration perspective, you will have a clear answer that with this industry seems to be good. Okay. For example, 2020, right. What happened right in 2020 on the line education. Value was migrating into online education by 2022 when COVID was done. What happened? The value started migrating out of online education. Okay. So this is going back to classrooms. They said that you know what? This is not replaceable. So changes happens in business fast and these are very, very prominent and important changes that that happens. Everyone with me. Okay. So this is literally point number one, right. That you need to be aware of. Okay. Second, very quick analysis that you should be doing is your point of entry. So yesterday I had spoken about point of entry aspect. Okay. So a good case study or a good example that I can give you is something like camps. Okay. So for example, camps I made like 100% turn up right and many of you and then I sold it. Okay. So let me just quickly pull up CDSL camps of Koi B. I'm in both same. Okay. Now, if you study like camps stock right from 2020, okay. And what do you will notice is that camps gave 2000% turn up. Okay. CDS. This is CDSL not camps. It gave 2000% turn up. Okay. So it gave like one rupee invested became 2000. Okay. Then how much has it corrected since it has corrected 38 39 40% right. So if you analyze post COVID right or around COVID, it is still and 1100% up. So it is this has gone up 11 times. Correct. Everyone gets it. Okay. Now there are two variants to this story. One is that C boss. This is corrected by 40%. So I should go and buy it now. Okay. Another point is that C I'm a long term investor. I'm investing for at least five years. If I'm putting money here, I need to think about it from a five year perspective. So on a five year basis, if I look at the five years because if I'm a long term investor, now what is the meaning of five year basis that at least I'll study the past five year data right. So on a five year basis, this has gone up 11X. Now, if you don't know any finance, economics, etc. What is the what is like a natural way of justifying this that okay, this stock deserves like an 11X. Very simple that okay, if it's revenues have gone up 11X or if it's profits have gone up 11X, so 11 nice, I at least five X five X. So then also it's fine. Okay. Then it kind of makes sense. But if that is not happening, it's a problem agree. Right. So let's quickly check this right. So here we go and start analyzing. This is CDSL, no, so CDSL, so CDSL, we go. We go profit and loss. So what was the situation like in 2019, right. 200 say five times over, right, like a four times over, in fact, right and profits have gone 115 to 420. So three times over. So okay, so profit revenues are going up 3X, 3X, 4X, but stock price is going. 11X despite 40% correction. So would you call it undervalued? Not really, you will not call it undervalued overvalued, I don't know, but definitely not undervalued. That's the best you can do. Okay, so then you start looking for signs of undervaluation, right. He can go. So I mean, maybe like if we look at peak, maybe it's undervalued there. Right. So let's go and study the P of CDSL. Okay. Like absolute P just like a random 46 copy is not cheap. Okay. So that's one. Now what is the meaning of P? Right. P is expected growth rate. For example, for companies that are growing really fast. Okay. You might expect the P to be 90 also. Okay. Some companies have like 1200 P also. Okay. For example, Nica and all right. DeMart has a P of 90 or all close to 100. Okay. So it's not as if he is. But P cannot expand this P can go to 90 also. Okay. This is a possibility. But if you have to think about it, the chances of P going to 90 is it very high, right. Or is the P going to like maybe like 35 higher, right. So I would say that this is more a more probabilistic scenario. Okay. Why? Because then you do like PR comparison. Okay. So you start analyzing. So the type of businesses. Okay. So for example, BSC is like at 70 P. Okay. CDSL 45 P. Cams 43 P. IEX 38. So TK current P case. You can see that. Okay. This is like a decent business. Maybe this is not like crazy high. But it is definitely not undervalued. This is where we can conclude. Everyone with me so far. Okay. And absolute P industry P analysis. K. Was a analysis. K. You reach that conclusion. And then you get the average P over the last five years. For CDSL is 46 and it is trading at roughly the same P. Okay. So then what is it that you are betting on if you are buying something like CDSL today. You're betting on growth rate. Correct. That it keeps on growing at really fast growth rate right. So where do you find growth rate. So you come here. You look at this. So on a three year basis the company has grown at 30%. Okay. On a five year basis this is growing at 30%. Now what is the meaning of 30% growth rate again rule of 72. 72 divided by 30. So this 30. This gives you what 2.2 or something. Okay. It tells you that the company doubles in size every 2.2 years. Okay. So this is the growth rate that the market is currently giving it. Now see now some industries can maintain that growth rate. For example, a company like CDSL you will make the argument that it is a monopoly stock. And because it is a monopoly stock the business will keep on doubling every 2 to 3 years. And therefore, you know, I'm okay like having a growth rate of 25 30. So again, here you need to go and benchmark it to the economy. Because economy grows at 67% right banks grow at 13%. Financial institutions are growing at sorry, whatever like stock market mutual fund thingies are going at like whateve
