SUMMARY:
The speaker discusses stock investing strategies, emphasizing the importance of focusing on fundamentally strong stocks ("good stocks") and using a combination of top-down and bottom-up analysis. Examples like CDSL and Swiggy are used to illustrate the concept of buying stocks after significant price corrections (e.g., 50% margin of safety) to reduce risk. The speaker highlights the importance of a stock's moat, growth potential, and survivability (e.g., Swiggy's strong brand and delivery network) while cautioning against stocks with uncertain long-term viability (e.g., Tata Motors). The talk also touches on capital rotation, swing trading, and the need for quick decision-making in investing, acknowledging that investors often operate with incomplete information.  

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Focus on fundamentally strong stocks**: Prioritize stocks with strong moats, growth potential, and clear business models (e.g., CDSL, Swiggy).  
- **Margin of safety matters**: Buy stocks after significant price corrections (e.g., 50% decline) to reduce downside risk.  
- **Top-down and bottom-up analysis**: Use both approaches to evaluate stocks, considering macroeconomic trends and company-specific fundamentals.  
- **Business survivability**: Favor companies with diversified revenue streams (e.g., Amazon over Google) and horizontal/vertical expansion potential (e.g., Swiggy entering new markets).  
- **Capital rotation strategy**: Shift investments to undervalued but strong stocks during market downturns.  
- **Quick decision-making**: Accept that investing often involves uncertainty and requires decisive action with incomplete information.  
- **Swing trading principles**: Look for clear support/resistance levels and 2:1 risk-reward ratios when trading (e.g., Swiggy's consolidation phase).  
- **Avoid uncertain bets**: Be wary of stocks with unclear long-term viability (e.g., Tata Motors in the EV space).  
- **Track corrections**: Price and time corrections can signal buying opportunities if the underlying business remains strong.  
- **Experiment wisely**: Allocate small portions of capital to high-conviction trades with stop-losses to limit losses.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
only on good stocks. Now, what does that mean of good stock? At least up screener pejake. Right? For example, if you are looking at Muthilaal, what is it that you will do? You will do a top down analysis. And you will do a bottom up analysis. And eventually, like you have a CDSL, like a case, for example, where you will see you will see that you lost CDSL. I am buying a 35% correction. This is good. Okay? I am going to do it. But the stock is at a 45p. This is confusing for me. I don't know how to, you know, act on this. Right? This looks dangerous. But it's a monopoly stock. Right? So, this is a good point. Right? But it has a very high growth rate 25%. I don't know if you are going to be able to make it. Again, like, I am not sure about that. So, basically, like on a happiness index, where are you? Right? Are you pessimistic about this stock? No. Is it a good stock? Yes. But it's not as if that this is a very clear buy. So, this top loss strategy or capital rotation strategy, you should apply on these type of undamentally good stocks, where the only question is their growth rate. Right? For example, no one will say that CDSL is a crap stock. Okay? It's a good stock. You are buying it at a good price also. It's not a problem. Right? Same applies for Swiggy, for example. Right? Swiggy. It's a good stock. No problem. Right? I mean, when we bought it at unlisted, we bought it at 360. It went to 600. Okay? Now, it is back to 350. Okay? So, because the entire market time, right? It's not as if that it's a Faldo fund stock and it has no margin of safety and all that. It will say that you had bought an unlisted, right? I mean, it's a good thing that you had listed it. See, boss, like, I cannot go back in the past and buy it. The market would have very well run forward. Okay? There is no fundamental risk on Swiggy and the motto. In the sense that, for example, it's a solid business. You keep on seeing Swiggy delivery guys, no matter delivery guys, delivering like orders. They have a massive moat. It's not as if Adaniji will come and he'll create a fleet of like, you know, 80 lakh riders for something. It doesn't make sense. Okay? So, from that angle, right? Yes. So, VCs will exit Swiggy. I 100% agree. But what is the margin of safety on Swiggy right now? It's 50%. Why? Because it went to 600. Now, it is at 350. So, there's almost a 50% margin of safety. You're buying some margin of safety. You know, Juneau, like that. It's cool, right? For example, pay Tima, Karythiweta, 1000 rupees. Right? And now, it has fallen to 500. Now, you're at a 50% loss. But if you're buying at a 50% loss, right? When the stock has corrected by 50%, you are already bought a 50% time correction. Okay? Sorry. 50% price correction. So, their chances of you losing crazy money is very less. Right? I hope this point is clear to everyone. Right? Okay. I'll just quickly take like some questions. Okay. Okay. Now, someone asked me about Tata Motors. Now, see, the problem with stocks like Tata Motors is the long term viability. Okay? For example, something like, let's say Swiggy is a motto, right? Will you still see drivers on Swiggy and Zomato after two, three years? Yes. Will you still see Tata Motors delivering excellent electric cars compared to Maruti, compared to Tesla, compared to BYD? I don't know. Okay. And that's a big question mark. Okay. That's problem one. Problem two. Swiggy and Zomato. Can it move to new industries? This is called as horizontal and vertical extension of businesses. Okay. For example, they can start selling concept tickets. Why? Because Swiggy and Zomato are very recallable brands. They can possibly take some market share away from Amazon. Can Tata Motors start selling concept tickets? Or what new business can it expand to? I don't know. Like, not much, I guess. Right? So it's a, it's a pure play. Automotive manufacturing business. Okay. So that's a problem. Right. So therefore, like I mean, the wider the mood of a business, okay, they're easier. It is right. So two different. For example, am I more comfortable buying Amazon or am I more comfortable buying Google? I'm more comfortable buying Amazon. Why? Because Google's almost 60% of revenues come from search engine marketing. Like that you go and type Google, Google tell me like good restaurants to eat near me. Then Google will tell you and show you an ad. So Google will make money. So almost 60, 70% 60% of Google's revenue come from that's from search engine marketing. Tools like publicity. I've stopped using Google. It's shit. Okay. So like I mean, I would rather use publicity and get my answers passed. Okay. So anyone people will migrate value migration is happening to publicity not on Google. When it comes to the 65% of their revenue in a way. Right. But when it comes to Amazon, right? It's different. Right. This has a much wider base. Right. So I mean, you have to think of business from a survivability point of view that okay. What which has a higher chance of surviving for the next three to five years. It's major revenue stream. Something like Amazon according to me, right? Google has Gemini ID, but I'm more, you know, I like. Yeah. So call India. We were talking about it. Someone asked me a good question. Let me go to the good questions. Okay. Okay. Good question. Okay. How do we keep track of overall investment gains loss and when we rotate capital. Yeah, the money is not right. Right. I mean, you're getting richer. Is that more important of keeping a track of how rich you're getting is more important? No, no, no. So like stop worrying about all that right. And you will get it on your console PNL. So go on like zero, the hour, whichever account you're using. Go on console and you will be able to do it. Okay. Will you add Swiggy now? I already have decent amount of Swiggy. So I'm not adding more. Right. I'll add NSC share right to be honest. Like I'll write a note tomorrow. Okay. Why? Because unlisted market works slightly differently than listed. But I can say that there is a real time price change on listed stocks. For example, if you're looking at CDSL, you will be able to figure out today's price. But in unlisted space, the price upgrade happens really slowly. Right. So for example, it will show you three old three month old data, four month old data. Right. So that it's not real time price updates that happen on it. Okay. So yeah. So anyways, I'll write a note. Right. I'll let you know. Yeah. Groke is also. Yeah. So I'll let you know, you know, use like. Get like faster response, right? So when I personally like public city, I like the interface. It's easy to read right and all that. So I like public city, whichever one you like you do it. Okay. I hope that this point is clear to everyone. Right. I mean, how to approach all these points. Right. Okay. Now, let me just quickly cover this analysis. So buying margin of safety is critical that you're buying price correction and time correction. And out of and here you will see like very clear bets. For example, just a private bank ETF. Okay. This is at a time correction. Right. Plus it's a good asset. Now, good asset. We have a separate class. So the next class that we do next week. I will literally just one class. I'll explain what good assets are. Okay. So this has like 18 fundamental features. I'll take you through it. Okay. So that will help you judge whether private money. TF is good. Swiggy or good. Tatum, Otas is good. So not right. At least you'll get an understanding. Okay. So this is like clear by now. Most of the time almost 50 60% of the time you have to make a judgment call. Okay. So again that, you know, you're the other marrying the story right that okay. Like, you know, how did he marry. Daddy right. Just he just went there. My to once and had to make a decision and he made a quick decision. Okay. That will be for the Shadi right. So that's very quick. Okay. So similarly, again, stocks also you have to make like very quick decisions. Right. That okay. Should you buy. Should you not buy and majority of the times you'll not get like full picture. Okay. That's a reality of practical reality of investing. Most of the time you'll be confused as long as you're buying time correction price correction. And have a very clear exit strategy in mind. You'll not take significant loss. Okay. For example, you might buy something as an experiment right. For example, you will say that. Let's put in a puntering. Right. For example, Swiggy. Right. So you'll open up. Swiggy. Okay. So, why the not. Okay. Okay. So here are Swiggy. Okay. Now it is. Now what is happening on Swiggy? You can very well see that here. There has been a 50% price correction. That's one piece of information. Right. Almost 50%. And there has been a consolidation. Now two scenarios can play out. Okay. One is that it can after consolidating. There can be a break out. Or after consolidation. There can be a break down. Okay. Now what is the problem? Where will you assign probability? You have to do it. You have to do it. Right. So where will you put it? Like I'll put it here. Okay. So break out. Okay. For wide variety of reasons. Okay. So you'll say that you can see boss. I have like one crore lying around. Like and that's like 10% of my network. And I want to gamble here. So what's the smart way of gambling? You invest, right? You invest like whatever 50 lacks. You invest a significant chunk with a stop loss. Okay. Why? Because there is a very clear two is to one trade here. Okay. So this is like one, right? And it's can you say this is the support. Right. So this is it. Again, if you do that analysis. This is a two is to one trade. And therefore it is a. Swingable asset. Right. So I'm trying to teach you like little bit of swing trading. Right. Everyone got it. Why? Right. And also like I mean, even before picking Swiggy as an asset, the asset itself should be good because that will reduce half of your risk. If you. Start experimenting on like,
