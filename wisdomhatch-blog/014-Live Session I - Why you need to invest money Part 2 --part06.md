==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses the delicate balance governments must maintain between economic growth (GDP) and inflation. It explains how excessive money printing (quantitative easing) can spur GDP growth but also lead to hyperinflation, which destabilizes societies by making essentials unaffordable, potentially triggering revolutions (e.g., French Revolution, Mughal Empire). Governments aim to show GDP growth annually, often overreporting GDP and underreporting inflation to appear successful. Real growth, driven by productivity (e.g., technology like self-driving cars), is deflationary, but money printing is inflationary. The speaker advises investors to account for real inflation (higher than reported) to protect wealth and adapt to economic cycles of growth and consolidation.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **GDP vs. Inflation:** Governments prioritize GDP growth but must avoid hyperinflation, which erodes purchasing power and can lead to social unrest.  
- **Quantitative Easing:** Printing money boosts GDP artificially but causes asset and essential goods prices to rise, hurting the poorest.  
- **Historical Precedents:** Hyperinflation has toppled empires (e.g., Mughals, Romans) and regimes (e.g., Russian Empire), emphasizing its dangers.  
- **Government Reporting:** Inflation is often underreported, and GDP overreported to mask economic weaknesses. Real inflation (~10%) exceeds official numbers (~6%).  
- **Investor Strategy:** Wealth must grow faster than real inflation (e.g., 12% returns to offset 10% inflation) to avoid losing purchasing power.  
- **Real Growth vs. Money Printing:** Technological advancements (e.g., autonomous cars) create real, deflationary growth, while money printing is a short-term inflationary fix.  
- **Economic Cycles:** Governments alternate between stimulus (growth) and consolidation (real productivity gains) to balance progress and stability.  
- **Tax Planning:** Seek low-tax jurisdictions (e.g., UAE) but stay adaptable to future policy changes.  
- **Macro Awareness:** Understanding these dynamics helps navigate investing, policy impacts, and personal financial planning.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
r economy but what's the downside what does it lead to it leads to something called as hyperinflation okay now for this what you need to understand is that you need to understand a very basic concept right um and governments what do they uh truly worry about right so what happens is and this is how you need to think about it you need to basically think about the goal of governments okay now government or like a country is like this car okay if you make Modi Ji the prime minister then Modi Ji the driver of this car okay so like and what is he kind of saying that he say that it was I'm like Michael Sumatra okay so I can drive like really fast okay and I'm the best guy okay and to prove that what does he want to what's the number that he worries about so number one he worries about GDP okay the faster you drive this car the more the GDP is right so for example therefore you keep on hearing all this BS that a GDP India third largest is that right and all that stuff right so let's make it like 50 trillion dollar economy and all that okay it keeps on happening so this is the first goal of the government to increase the GDP so in order to increase the GDP what can you do you can do quantitative easing right and that will create like a lot of growth right I mean if you print like 10 trillion rupees then India can become a 10 trillion rupees economy but what would it lead to it will lead to every day increase in prizes because it leads to asset price appreciation right now asset price appreciation not just happens on gold silver real estate all that stuff but it happens on apples oranges wheat dhal chava everything why because suddenly people 2 x or 3 x their money overnight then the price of everything also goes 3 x 4 x right so therefore the second goal of government is to keep inflation in check or inflation low why because this is where revolution starts because think about it this way that if the cost of apple goes from 100 rupees in 2025 to 1000 rupees next year or if the cost of rice goes from 50 rupees to 5000 rupees next year what do you think people who are unable to eat will do they will be on roads right they will block everything they will like you know kill the police or whatever right so I mean there's just madness that will go has it happened in history yes read French revolution read read any like any empire that has fallen right from Romans to ashtag empire Egyptians muggles the first thing that you will notice that there is inflation that happens a crazy amount of inflation okay for example muggles used to issue coins which are made of pure gold and it used to be this thick whatever that thickness was now towards the end of the muggles empire that the gold coins were made you know one tenth the their weights right same value what is that that's inflation okay so the bottom line I'm trying to tell you is that this inflation reflects on multiple ways similarly the there's a very good Netflix series it's called as ZARS CZAR which shows the decline of the russian empire right and how it the last ZARS that's the name of the series right if you go and watch it so the last ZARS or the last king of Russia was so disconnected from the from the reality that he had like no clue how much his general population was suffering now when do general population suffers when they don't have food to eat okay why do you think India is distributing so much freebies like Aata Dahls I will just free carry though right back he's right so why is that that is happening because a large section of India if they don't get free food they will revolt okay so figuring out and this that is the biggest nightmare of politicians so the twin goal of politicians is very simple right that number one improved GDP number two but not at the cost of inflation you can't have a revolution going on because that just kills the social structure okay so these two are two things of the opposite side of the coin if you print too much money very quickly then what it does is that it increases inflation in the economy and it brings a revolution so controlling both of these things is very important in fact if you look at the why do you think that the NIM government reports like inflation is 6% but if you go and check your own electricity bill this bill that bill and all that you will find inflation to be 10% so inflation data is always under reported but GDP data is always over reported okay why because it makes the government looks great okay so that's the bottom line right but to us as normal people who are investing our own wealth we need to be cognizant that about boss the inflation is 10 so I should at least grow my wealth at 12 okay so that is the type of strategy I should adopt but if if people who are dumb with economics they will assume that inflation is 6 pf middle they are 8 so bilirah right and tax free so my money is growing money is growing on paper okay excel right it not knowing in reality okay you lose money right so that's the practical difference okay everyone gets this okay okay okay so this is very important right so the goal is that see if the government does quantitative easing too fast right then what will happen inflation will also happen very fast right therefore and but if the government does not do quantitative easing then what will happen the economy will go sideways right why because most of the growth that we see in the world is money printed growth okay so the game that that has happened now is that increase accelerate growth then stagnate it then accelerate growth stagnate it now why are they why is this period really important this period of stagnation if you understand this then you understand how the investing because this is where real growth in GDP comes from okay for example if autonomous cars or self driving cars get built in the world what do you think will happen the real productivity in the world will improve why because people will have to spend less on transport they can reach faster through their workplace they can work more they can work while driving right they can work on their laptops or whatever right so then the enforcers will say you know what okay hard to take office I'm gonna do one to come come come come come come right and all that stuff so all that stuff will happen so basically when you are when humans are working in absolute basis they will increase real GDP in the economy okay so for example if India's growth rate or GDP growth rate is 6 6 and a half percent then four five of it is coming from inflation and 1% is real yeah similarly if you have to in this consolidation period right so we are waiting let's say that we have three years of consolidation then in three years of consolidation a few things will happen for example there will be faster semiconductor there will be faster processing times on things there will be improvement in technology there will be self driving cars I don't know right there will be hundred different things that will add productivity to the real world so that will genuinely like bring down debt and that will create something called as deflation okay so real growth is deflationary every year understands this statement okay money printing is inflationary so you print money because and the problem or the dichotomy here is that the governments have to show growth every year like incorporates need to show your salary growth every year you cannot say that you know what increase my salary once every three years you want salary increase every year that's a bad thing for nine year right laptop fake deniers I salary increase is not there right so I'll like do three job doing it right so the point is we are impatient okay so similarly with government also this is a genuine problem that they have to illustrate growth every single year but I'm not right so their strategy is very simple that increased growth either through money printing or by creating real growth will real growth happen in the world yes okay with time it will and therefore you increase growth create fake GDP then consolidated create real growth in both these phases and somehow balance the world right this is where we will stop okay I hope you enjoyed the first session right in the evening we'll complete the macro class but just to quickly consolidate five six topics that we studied we studied about different asset classes we studied what bad asset class looks like according to me pf e pf all that what is portfolio building it means having green signals across your five six asset classes that you're picking what is dead bubble how it exactly reflects what is asset price appreciation liquidity increase quantitative easing what is the meaning in the evening we will start the class with quantitative tightening okay all right so at this day I'll start taking questions guys but these were some of the primary points that we studied and hopefully this was not too taxing these are all very complicated macro topics that I tried to explain in simple language right I'll start taking questions from tofique okay and then you know I'll answer like 10 to 12 questions from the chat and then I'll open up the speaker also and then you guys can speak okay UAE has 0% taxation since there is no guaranteed will not change the coming as how should we plan for it on our macro level see go to lowest tax possible economy now will UAE be forever be a lower tax account I don't know like so but is it now so you plan there and then eventually you come out of it in case then increase taxes so but for now you should I don't think see UAE good thing is that it's a tax it's a cash rich economy so there is no incentive for them to increase taxes too much but you have to see this in relation to the world for example UK has close to 40 45% taxation which is absolute crazy in that context if UAE is incorporating 9% corporate tax it kind of makes sense right so not a problem and especially given the facilities that you get right so for example yeah when it
