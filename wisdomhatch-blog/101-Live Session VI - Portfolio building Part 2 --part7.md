==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a discussion between individuals about investment strategies, primarily focusing on US markets. Key topics include portfolio diversification, risk management, tax implications for Indian investors in US stocks, market trends (recession predictions, sideways consolidation), and comparisons between US indices like the S&P 500 and Russell 2000. The speaker advocates for investing in downtrends during recessions, emphasizes data-driven decisions over advisor opinions, and cautions against overexposure to single stocks or small-cap indices. There’s also mention of European companies (e.g., Louis Vuitton, Novo Nordisk) and their growth constraints due to economic policies. The conversation ends with a query about balancing US and Indian stock holdings for an Indian resident.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
1. **Diversification & Risk Management**: Avoid overexposure to single stocks (e.g., Amazon, Google); spread risk across holdings.  
2. **Sideways Market Strategy**: In a consolidating market, retain positions (e.g., booking 15–20% profits) to avoid chasing breakouts.  
3. **Recession Investing**: Buying during downtrends (e.g., 2020, 2008 recessions) is optimal, but the speaker predicts a sideways market, not an imminent recession.  
4. **US vs. Small-Cap Indices**: S&P 500 and Nasdaq outperform Russell 2000 (small-cap) historically; avoid blanket small-cap investments without data.  
5. **Tax Considerations**: Indian investors in US stocks face high LTCG taxes (e.g., 20%); relocating to tax-friendly jurisdictions (e.g., UAE) could mitigate this.  
6. **European Stocks**: Companies like Louis Vuitton or Novo Nordisk offer value but grow slower due to Europe’s less capitalist, austerity-driven economy.  
7. **Balancing Portfolios**: For Indian residents with disproportionate US holdings, strategic rebalancing or tax-residency changes may be needed long-term.  
8. **Data over Opinions**: Rejecting celebrity fund managers’ advice, the speaker stresses relying on historical data (e.g., TradingView charts) for decisions.  
9. **ETF Query**: No explicit ETF recommendation for European "GRANOLAS" or Magnificent 7-like companies; focus remains on individual stock analysis.  
10. **Long-Term Holding**: Avoid premature selling of US stocks; tax efficiency and residency plans should guide liquidation timing.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
percent invested in the markets in the Nasdaq right and keep 20 percent cash that's at most understood we're valued for example like I mean if T looks fairly valued now so it's all in okay so that's okay understood with respect to US markets so right now the way my like so I'm a salaried person so the way my composition is structured unfortunately my saving spot fully is mostly index towards US stocks essentially so right now I mean both Amazon and Google like Amazon is like around 20 percent from peak and Google is like 30 percent from peak downwards so does it make sense to diversify a little bit sell Amazon by Google and then you know have that kind of balance at this point it makes sense right I mean because see any stock you should not be overexposed right that's the idea we get retail investors I mean what why do we care right I mean whether we make money from Amazon or we make money from Google or we make money from XYZ so spread our risks okay third quick question is when you say like book profits like 15 20 percent you have always been saying that that 15 20 percent number where is that number coming from so for example why not like 50 percent booker to try you keep using that money for something else why like 15 20 percent because our high my hypothesis right now is that we'll go into a sideways consolidation which means that we will have that sine wave thing that it will go up go down go up go down it's that's what sideways consolidation means in such a market retaining position is important because if the market goes up what will you sell if you have nothing to say for example if you lower your holdings from 100 units to 50 units and if there's a breakout or up move what will you sell I mean then you will chase the market right so and the urges to not chase the market the urges to build protection in a sideways market right and wait for a down to buy more one another question is like for example with respect to US stocks so it assumes that I for the remaining 10 years I work and live in India so after certain point in time let's say my US portfolio builds to quite some amount and if I bring that money back to India I'll be tax a lot I think US LTC is higher probably I think it's 20 percent LTC for US stocks so is it so are there like so for example let's say if I plan to move to Dubai or any other country so then I can reduce the tax burden right at that point in time like maybe 5 10 is down the line in terms of a long term strategy correct okay one request I have is like you mentioned the type of stocks right poor and then consistent compounders and so on in that excel when you share that if you can provide some examples of the stocks and the strategy like just one for example in consistent compounders you have like follow at 200 DMA broadly just broad ideas and the examples of stuff that would be helpful okay I'll do that okay thanks thank you the via pranesh hello there's not there hello can you hear me yeah I can yes so earlier in your point you earlier in your doc you raised a point about you know you are actually waiting for recession in order to deploy a lot of your money that you actually have saved up so I come across a lot of news I know that you are completely averse to the kind of news that comes in but I'm talking about the US news that you know every day they are either saying that we are in a recession or we are going in a recession very soon so do you think we do you think the US stock market is actually or not US stock market but the US economy is actually in a recession right now or going into a recession right now very soon I mean how right so tomorrow I'll I'll release a video right on this public video right I've been about US recession right so please watch that you'll get mortality but short answer is that US economy is not in a recession right now economists forecast that there is a 20 to 50 percent chance that US economy will go into a recession the last two recessions were 2020 and 2008 right so these were recession periods if you buy stocks in a recession period that's the best time to buy stocks why because you're buying a downtrend okay a massive downtrend right the more you buy the better it is so people make fun and you know like that okay you're buying the dip with the then you buy another dip of the dip and then you buy dip of the dip of the dip of the dip and all that but the point is that it works okay so like it's easy to make one but it's very difficult to make money and people who understand this right I mean if your initial point of acquisition is great then you will make money right I will you run out of capital at some point buying the dips yes that's okay it's not as if that money will not be remade right I mean markets will anyways come up okay my reading is that my reading is that we'll not go into a recession to be honest like not anytime soon but we will test that minus 20 percentish thing we will see a long sideways consolidation that's what I'm betting on okay I hope there is a recession it's more much easier right but it opens up like more investment opportunities but I don't think there will be one okay uh also you know I uh in all your lectures till now you have talked mostly about SMP 500 or basically the index SMP index of of US which is like about the 500 SMP 500 primarily but just like the way we see a nifty uh made cap stout some small cap stout I believe that in US the SMP made cap also at least from the way I have seen okay I know that I'll bring Sarav Mukherjee here but Sarav Mukherjee also says that you know the SMP made cap is much more the companies in them are much more better than let's say the made caps of India they are much more cleaner or something like that so I want to say that now we have invested so much good amount of money in 500 SMP 500 do you also consider SMP made cap to be basically just like the way let's look at it though so SMP 500 is this because I cannot like you know comment on a celebrity fund manager like an column idiot right so like I don't know what it's to say right so for example this is Russell 2000 okay so this is like small cap index in the US okay this is Russell 2000 just I'm not able to see it okay okay so this is Iwn okay so this is Russell 2000 okay now here is SMP 500 right on this blue chart is Russell 2000 okay so let's do the comparison from 2020 SMP 500 which is a lower risk index out performs Russell 2000 in the US okay this is not me saying or Sauramokarji saying or etc etc if you consider like our 10 year basis it still SMP 500 still out performs Russell 2000 okay if you take off 15 year basis SMP 500 still out performs Russell 2000 and here I'm looking at SMP 500 if I add NASDAQ to this okay so let me add NASDAQ okay okay here is NASDAQ now this purple line now it beats SMP 500 also it picks beats small cap index in the US also the entire theory that small cap index in the US out performs like other indices in the US is nonsense okay and anyone who had access to like trading view will tell you in three minutes right with the data right but I don't know like I'm in what to say to that right when people are paying like mad money to like investment advisors and like giving 2 to 2 percent of their portfolio on your key basis for this advisor I don't trust me don't trust anyone just look at the data and why would you invest like in Russell 2000 in general right so specific swing trades are fine but as a general rule you should not be buying like small cap index in the US the reason is that I just showed you data on that okay you also talk about ESMM which is like you know another fabrication company which which is many other companies who are creating iPads or doobel phones they need help from these companies I know that this company comes into let's say how in the US you have those like the 5th and 7 companies in Europe you have granolas under which ASML comes there are also other companies like you know Louis Vuitton some luxury food come under plus so do you suggest any ETF for this or even before suggesting ETF do you look at these companies I mean you have prayer you have talked primarily about individual companies like ASM but not about you know how this feels like a magnetism not feels like and this is a magnificent 7 of Europe European company so do you know so M7 companies in US works very differently because the US does quantitative easing the US Europe for example is a socialist economy right I mean they provide a lot of social benefits compared to the US European is Europe is less capitalist compared to US so they borrow less and they exhibit something called as austerity and as a result European countries companies do not grow that much for example consider no one orders right consider like Louis Vuitton right their growth rate has been slow because of this reason right so this is one right should you buy these companies yes they are value wise now right so for example something like Louis Vuitton is a great value by this young chair I am adding it right if you consider something like no one orders it's 45-50% down from its peak great company right the weight loss drug that they have launched it's it's doing well right so yeah I mean overall it's solid right but you again need to learn how to build positions on that okay my last question is more of an observation in my portfolio I have been investing in US talks for quite some time it's been almost three more than three three and a half years I ended up buying some major companies like for example Amazon when it was at 99 or 110 times at that point of time so now what has happened is that my the amount that I have in my US talks is kind of higher than the amount that I have in my Indian stocks how do I keep on considering I'm in India and doing too much of profit also you don't need to sell your US talks right I mean see imagine this right for example if let's say you become a tax resident of UAE at some stage okay so let's say when
