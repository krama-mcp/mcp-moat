SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a transcript of a Q&A session covering various topics, primarily focused on real estate investment, stock market strategies, and cryptocurrency. The speaker advises against investing in highly inflated and corrupt real estate markets like Gurudgaon, recommending instead livable areas with less builder dominance. For stocks, the speaker emphasizes rotating investments rather than exiting entirely and cautions against overexposure to single stocks like RSUs. On cryptocurrency, they suggest cautious, incremental investment in Bitcoin. The session also touches on the improbability of returning to a gold standard for currencies and the enduring strength of the US economy.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- Avoid corrupt and overpriced real estate markets (e.g., Gurudgaon); focus on livable areas with genuine demand.  
- Real estate investment should prioritize properties you would personally want to live in.  
- Rotate stock investments within similar assets instead of fully exiting the market.  
- Limit overexposure to single stocks (e.g., RSUs) to mitigate risk.  
- Bitcoin is highly volatile; build positions gradually (e.g., 20-30% of intended allocation).  
- A return to the gold standard for currencies is unlikely due to the power dynamics of money printing.  
- The US economy remains strong due to its consumer base, spending power, and reserve currency status.  
- Real estate is a financing game; prioritize properties with positive cash flow (e.g., high rental yields).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
about the hard wallet so yes is there any way to procure the hard wallet I mean how do you put it on Amazon Amazon you can buy okay so it's called as Mano Ledger X okay and will you be sharing your email ID if you need to have some queries yes I'll do that on the group guys I'll take like one minute break okay so I have to put like something out right so I'll just give me like a minute I'll just be quick all right he gets I'm back so panel okay so panel mayang shikha so no yes anyone there okay anyone can ask if you are there okay I'll go from mayang command you're there hi actually yes so first of all a big thank you to you for these four weekends really an insightful session yes so my question is around the property stuff you have been telling us so say I'm a small ticket investor in a city like Gurudan or a metropolitan and basically I am from Gurudan, modern border in Gurudan, living in my family so I have that benefit I am living in my family but we are looking to invest we are still at a say 42 50 lap of a family income say pre-tax and I am looking at properties in Gurudan, it's highly inflated everybody knows but as you mentioned we can go to a to city or to city we can you know look out for some smaller cities where we can you know do that but then again flipping properties or getting generating any rental returns is difficult rental is good at a place like Gurudan right but not at a place in a tier to city right so how can a small ticket investor like me scout for a good property because we have limited information and then there are builders making full out of retailers every day and just connected to this so you give an example like in Dubai you water property at 1600 the dumpster BSM and then somebody was selling at twice the rate so same happens in Gurudan also so in that case like there's this market in Gurudan where we see if dlf says we are selling this size of property save or 1cr and even if it's worth 60 or 70 lakhs m3 and more any other build-up will come up and say that we will sell it for 1.1 or 1.2 or maybe the same amount so everybody is trying to jack up the prices so how as a small ticket investor I can scout for a good property like how can I save myself basically see honestly like don't engage in markets which are corrupt now India unfortunately is a highly corrupt market to begin with if you start to engage with builders right in India high ticket builders right it becomes even more challenging my now the question that you have asked it necessitates a very elaborate response or not the right forum but very quickly what I'll explain is that go to markets in India which are not dominated by builders right so that's where you can make money otherwise you'll not make money if you're buying it from like you know corrupt builders and a daily go to go you will never get a good deal right from them okay it's like really bad Gurudan is not the place to buy properties you'll buy really high inflated prices Gurudan grew really fast it is maturing because of dilly right so dilly people massive influx very high property prices a lot of rich guys I have friends right I mean who have like who lives in like friends call me owning like 100 crore bungalows and whatnot making a yield of 1% okay so like ancestral properties and all that right so like the bottom line being that because the property prices were so inflated in dilly people move to Gurudan now what's the thesis on Gurudan right there is no longdom thesis there right I mean it's concrete jungle yeah there's no boy cost of laying is way too high right in Gurudan right so I would say that go to like livable locations the rule number one of buying properties that you buy property in an area where you would you yourself would like to live okay so every property that I own I love it because I myself would want to spend time on that property right so if you if that is not happening that's like step one of not buying a property okay so another question is that you gave that roadmap of stages of health right so if I talk about the stage one is it based on a single person's income or a household income like how do we track it yeah household income yes okay okay thank you yeah uh shekha harish uh thank you for the fantastic session I follow you anyways my first point I'm sorry if I'm a screener and if you've covered screeners uh because even to analyze talks you kind of first need to shortlist so you've covered them I just need to go through oh no so you don't need to shortlist talk that's my point right I mean there are 6000 stocks how will you shortlist them right so I mean okay fine I tell you a screener now you're able to bring down your 6000 stocks let's say um 100 now we are are you going to spend like another five hours analyzing those 100 stocks so none is probably you know you don't need to become a research analyst the point is that anyways that info is going to reach to you right one way or the other if you are reading newspaper if you are reading like basic stuff on Twitter someone someone will come and say that you know okay then Nvidia looks like great so then the decision that you need to make is that whether or not you should be Nvidia should be adding Nvidia right now or not okay and that's the decision point the decision point is not how you screen Nvidia okay okay about it uh secondly uh do you see uh any US currency or Indian currency or mixed up currencies being uh uh going back to gold standards in the foreseeable future it's not happening so unless you have very powerful governments that will never happen because money printing is free money for the president prime minister well I would give up on that power right it's very difficult to take back power from people right so sorry power from leaders right so that will not happen unless you become like a frecar right or something that's it's not what happened right so in not any time soon okay and my third last question would be uh do you how do you see Nasdaq US top market going beyond Trump from probably it's the last term for him is it still yeah it's very good right so I mean I think uh US see I mean US genuinely has firepower right it's not as if that they are just bluffing right I mean their customer base is very strong they have the spending power they have reserve currency status those are extremely privileged powers right and for a foreseeable future US will be very strong force okay so it's not as if that US is a weak economy do not believe in that okay irrespective of what is happening whatever is happening in the US US still remains a very strong economy right has up now okay thank you for the fantastic sessions thank you Rish hi actually the sessions was very helpful thanks a lot for that so I started investing in shop market from last year yeah I made some mistakes but I learned some few things from you I'll try to implement that so I have few questions I mean actually I'm a software engineer in a product based company yeah a few company RS use I'm like like a 40% more than 40% last session you told that and it's better to keep like I don't 10% or something like that yeah uh interviews mean something like a most you know still is still all 40% is at once I mean not so see rotate right so it's not selling selling means that you sold and went away okay rotating means that you sold something at 100 rupees and immediately you rotated that money into the market into some other assets okay so it's not as if that you're making like some grave mistake or in one day NASDAQ will try is by like 50% and you'll miss all the rally or nothing of that sort will happen right so just rotate within similar companies right so where for example if you have RSC use from amazon this by like Microsoft also google also whatever like NASDAQ also all that right yeah got it okay and I explained future also I'm in albegetting may if the quarter will be getting uh the stocks to be wasted actually so uh so you keep on doing that so you keep on playing that game and uh one more question I have so monicry explain about smr like in the index we need to follow that was very helpful so can you follow the same one bitcoin also went to end so bitcoin is very volatile so you don't apply that bitcoin was differently so I'll not you know bring it up on this chat right now and maybe I'll write a note or something right yeah yeah we're not to went to end the person is uh I wanted to invest right now you can buy a little bit right so maybe like build 20% of the positions that you eventually want to build 20 30% it's good not a problem okay one last question yeah so I mean actually recently bought a flat when I took a loan and I'll try to currently in the e-mails so my question to is I mean how much are Sundays or another particular should be should be in real estate uh depends on a lot of things right so how big is your overall portfolio what rent are you getting cash flow etc so again I mean I don't want to touch too much real estate because then I'll give like premature advice and you will take it as the face value and you will get logged into something like so I'll not I'll refrain from commenting actually you don't 60 50 uh uh raise to let 60% equity and 40% to other one so that's the one person I wanted to invest in some other real estate so that's the reason I got this question uh see it depends on the quality of real estate that you're getting right I mean for example if you're able to find a real estate is a financing game real estate is not really like anything else right for example in Dubai real estate works wonderfully well because you can potentially buy properties which I give generating seven and a half percent yield and you're paying five and a half percent VMI yeah yeah it's net positive right so there is you can buy infinite such properties okay so as long as you have 20% down payment so I keep on looking I mean I study like maybe hundred properties every 15 days right on in Dubai right so
