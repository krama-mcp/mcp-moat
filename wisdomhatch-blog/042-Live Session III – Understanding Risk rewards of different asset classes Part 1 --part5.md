SUMMARY:
**  
The text emphasizes the importance of diversification and broad decision-making in stock market investing, rather than focusing on micro-level choices. It highlights the significance of the Price-to-Earnings (PE) ratio as a critical tool for valuation. The author explains how to analyze PE ratios in three contexts: absolute PE (historical trends), industry PE (sector benchmarks), and peer PE (comparable companies). Using Kotak Mahindra Bank as an example, the text demonstrates how to evaluate whether a stock is fairly valued, undervalued, or overvalued by comparing these metrics. Key insights include the need to consider future earnings (forward PE) and qualitative factors like industry prospects and company performance.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Diversification is key:** Avoid making micro-decisions; focus on broad, strategic choices in investing.  
- **PE ratio is powerful:** It helps contextualize stock prices by linking them to earnings, similar to how salary relates to skills.  
- **Three PE analyses matter:**  
  1. **Absolute PE:** Compare the stock's current PE to its historical average.  
  2. **Industry PE:** Benchmark against sector averages (e.g., private banks in India).  
  3. **Peer PE:** Evaluate against competitors (e.g., HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank).  
- **Forward PE is critical:** Future earnings growth can justify higher stock prices or reduce PE ratios over time.  
- **Qualitative factors matter:** Assess industry trends, company performance, and market share alongside quantitative metrics.  
- **Avoid overvaluation:** Discard stocks with PE ratios significantly higher than industry or peer averages.  
- **Example:** Kotak Mahindra Bank's PE analysis shows it is fairly valued when all three PE criteria align.  
- **Fundamental analysis:** Combining PE metrics with growth momentum (e.g., rising profits) helps identify undervalued opportunities.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ou have to be diversified and you have to make broad decisions you can't make microdiscisions everyone with me okay now so then what do we do like I mean do we just randomly like you know put a finger up in the air and just buy whatever no we do it via PE ratio okay this is the most powerful ratio right and if you know how to use it well it kind of solves a lot of issues for you okay now what ends up happening is that when you start investing you will always look at price that's it okay what you will see is that okay area stock but it is going up so I'll buy it okay because it will constantly forever like I'm if you speak with like a money manager who will you know last 20 years you know go to Minderavan because we were like 20 person so in next 20 years it will again give to help us and so you can't do all this okay so this is like because you're only looking at price okay price always needs to be seen in context of its earning okay now what do I mean mother for example it's like your salary should be seen in context of your skills okay if you just simply say that you know what I used to make like 10 lacks and now in like 2020 now I'm making 50 lacks and you ask that should I do I deserve this 50 lack salary half of the idiots will say no like even it's such fast salary in case you should not happen this that stuff this that by the way they go with okay what skills have I developed right so that is a natural response that you will give me because in 2020 I used to help my company make when my 10 lakh rupees salary I used to help the company make 20 lacks okay hypothetically so company used to pay me 10 lacks now I'm getting 50 lacks salary from my company because I'm helping my company make 5 crores so maybe like even this 50 lack is underpaid are you getting what I'm trying to say so therefore like number one thing that you need to do in the stock market says never look at price of a stock alone okay it's useless okay you have to figure out like a broad broad math of understanding the valuation every one with me okay so this PE ratio is like your salary to skill ratio okay so for example if a company price is high okay but in the future its earnings can also go high okay then probably it's okay for you to buy it by that company at the top okay but on the flip side if the industry shrinking industry prospects are not there business sucks okay the company's losing market share hundred different problems happening with the company and the company is overvalued should you buy that company no okay so these are qualitative factors that you can judge to figure out the price okay so now let me help you understand how you analyze PE ratio and what is the meaning of PE ratio so PE so there are two types of in fact multiple types of PE ratio one is the current PE ratio so what do you see here is for example 20 this is the current price to earning ratio okay or like yeah okay now there is something called as forward PE ratio okay so forward PE comes up to you in the next 12 months what is going to happen to be or me okay so what we need to worry about a company is forward P not necessarily the current P okay for example this stock is available at 2079 okay and this is the current price or a current price of the stock okay so for example here if you check right okay what you will notice is this matrix it is called as earning per share EPS earning per share so what you will notice from this that there has been a consistent increase in earning per share okay now let's say that this is for the year 2025 right so this what we need 25 let's add 2026 man right let's say that this becomes 180 EPS okay and the stock price remains the same for example here the stock price was 2000 and here in 2025 it was 2000 here also it remains 2000 now because earning per share has expanded by roughly like you know what like 40% 33 40% the PE ratio will come down by 40% do you understand how okay why because earning per share EPS is increasing okay and price is staying the same so now because the denominator is increasing the PE ratio will come down further okay and as long as the company keeps on increasing its profits revenues more importantly profits and its EPS earning per share the PE ratio will keep going down and down okay so this is called as absolute PE analysis okay so the first type of analysis that you need to do on PE ratio is called as absolute PE three analysis that you need to number one is called as PE absolute okay number two is PE industry and number three PE of peers okay so all these three PEs need to be looked in conjunction with each other okay it's not as if that you can just analyze this and you're done or you can just analyze this and you're done or you can just analyze this and you're done you have to see all these three things together okay so we start with the industry PE first okay so industry PE so what type of a bank is Kotech Mindra bank it's a private bank in Indian okay and what typically like is the private bank PE right so if you study the history you will see this dotted line that roughly the PE of Kotech Mindra bank in the past has existed at around 30 okay then you look at other top banks also similar category right so access bank of PE they go there you'll get this cash bus never look at prices is useless okay it's not right I mean it's like whatever like 15 16 up HDFC they go right um HDFC bank okay okay so here you will see like 20 and all that right so now you use little bit of publicity right you ask that what is the average P what is the the historic PE of Indian top private so you will get wide range right for example atara bees these and all that okay now so basically right now if you just ballpark it just for example Kuchbang's a 31 Kuchbang's a 18 Kuchbang's a 20 and you have to you can see industry PE of private bank so we are trying to analyze the industry PE you know industry PE of private sector banks in India okay okay so industry comparison see the average P for banking industry has seen fluctuations dropping from 46 all the way till 14 okay so now you will get a range okay so of course you're not going to get like a solid number okay so this is like a data that we were looking at right so what do we see that okay the industry PE of private banks in India is roughly like between 14 and 44 okay a set times it can go to 44 also in bad times it can fall to 14 also everyone with me right so we go to Kotech Minder bank again right we were analyzing that now what is like now if we kind of see like the PE ratio like of the industry it was between 14 and 44 okay so this is the data that we get okay so now this is where like this is if we plot it this is this could be termed as fair right I mean because Kotech Minder bank compared to an average private bank it will consider come up in the top category okay everyone with me so here you know what how to do it so it's like from an industry PE wise at least it does not look over valued is this a statement that we can make we can make that right so reasonably okay what's the second thing that okay absolute P this is the second P analysis that we need to do so here the average PE of Kotech Minder bank is 30 okay in the last five years okay last five years and here we are getting it at 21 so is this undervalued yes definitely undervalued how much 33% right so significant difference even if it goes back to its previous PE that's very nice okay then we look at peers that is it like comparable or is it like way off for example ICICI is almost like 19 this is 21 this is 20 so cut cut paper hour right I mean it's almost at similar scale it's not as if that this is massively overvalued or undervalued rough rough net net it's fair so all three PE criteria get passed everyone with me industry P seems fair absolute P seems fair PRP seems fair okay we are not trying to figure out undervaluation we are just trying to see if it is not off the charts right as I need to know that industry P typically is like you know 20 and this stock is trading at 90 okay that should not happen right as long as overvaluation is not there it's fine so we are just trying to discard bad things okay so if we find like any red flags we cut that stock okay then what is the next most important question that we need to estimate the next most important question we need to estimate is that what is likely to be the forward P of Kotech Minder bank okay now how do you estimate this it's very simple see if the profits are likely to expand further if earnings are likely to expand further the earnings will improve and as a result the P will fall that's option one or the price will rise and P will remain the same you got how because if earnings are growing profits are growing then E is also growing and if E is growing then P multiple is coming less okay this is one scenario so the P will get cheaper or the second thing that will happen is that the price will also rise and the P will remain the same okay so this is this fourth trigger is very very important because if you feel that the stock revenue wise and profit wise is in a bullish momentum okay so for example here is momentum and you can judge it for example every quarter on quarter if you take a look profits have gone up right so 2024 the data is not right profits have gone up right here a little bit of shrinkage right if you look at it on a year wise basis with the revenues may not be taken out there you have to look at a year wise basis so all time high profits sorry revenues all time high profits if you look at TTM which is last 12 months all time high revenues all time high profits so is the forward P in the earnings is it going to grow or is it going to shrink the earnings is going to grow okay so either the stock price should go up or the P will come down okay so this is the bottom line right so I hope that this point is clear okay and therefore it is somewhat undervalued so this is called as fundamental analysis now what people typically
