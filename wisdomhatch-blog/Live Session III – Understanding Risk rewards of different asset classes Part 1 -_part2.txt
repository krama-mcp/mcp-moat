SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses the challenges of managing large portfolios versus small ones, using Warren Buffett's decreasing returns over decades as an example of how scalability impacts performance. It emphasizes the agility advantage of small retail investors compared to large institutional ones. The latter part shifts to macroeconomics, addressing concerns about the US dollar's dominance, the historical transition from gold to fiat currency, and the slow-moving nature of economic shifts. The speaker advises against overreacting to currency replacement theories (e.g., BRICS, Bitcoin) in the short term and stresses the importance of investor self-awareness and diversification across asset classes (e.g., stocks, real estate, BTC) based on personal comfort and valuation.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Portfolio Size Matters**: Smaller portfolios (e.g., retail investors) are more agile and can outperform large funds (e.g., Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway) due to easier capital rotation.  
- **Scalability Challenges**: As funds grow (e.g., Quant Mutual Fund), generating high returns becomes harder due to increased AUM (Assets Under Management) and complexity.  
- **US Dollar Dominance**: While the USD is declining slowly, its replacement (e.g., by BRICS, gold, or Bitcoin) is a long-term process; short-term investment strategies shouldn’t overreact to this trend.  
- **Historical Context**: Fiat currency replaced the gold standard post-WWII, with the USD's strength tied to its global trade dominance (60–65% of world trade).  
- **Investor Clarity**: Successful investing requires understanding one’s own strategy (e.g., concentrated bets on BTC/real estate vs. diversification) and avoiding comparison with others’ approaches.  
- **Diversification**: The speaker prefers diversifying within themes (e.g., buying multiple bank stocks if bullish on finance) rather than extreme concentration.  
- **Slow Economic Shifts**: Macroeconomic changes (e.g., currency systems) unfold over decades, requiring patience and long-term perspective.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 need more than 20 mutual funds okay now is if there are like you know so many right almost like 4000 plus mutual funds there etc etc what ends up happening is that see you know quant mutual fund will keep on making the noise by our as a investor though you make like 20% CGR on large caps and they might very well be doing it but you might invest with them when when their AUM has got going on. This to this okay now handling like a 10 billion dollar portfolio is much more complicated than handling a 1 billion dollar portfolio okay just for context and again this is something that you can fact check on chat GPT right so you go and study Mr Warren Buffett's return on your vice basis right so just simply right that Warren Buffett returns decade vice okay and you'll find something very interesting okay So for example here he made 29 between the year 1965 to 1974 29.5 between this he made 25 and this is decade vice okay then 20% then 6.9 then 7.4 and then 11.8 now there'll be one thing right was Mr Warren Buffett a much smarter investor here or is he much more experienced and smarter investor at 0.2 at 0.2 he's more experienced right I mean he legends he's pro canal as a legend right and you can beat him and now right I mean this why are you a genius no like I'm we're idiots but still we can beat him why because we are what portfolio we have like 100 grots right yoga what a portfolio is that's a what is Mr Warren Buffett's portfolio it's 600 billion dollars is it easy to move an elephant or is it easy to move up you know out of like you know small dog is like faster cat is faster yes so it's more agile right so therefore like you as a small retail investor as much higher odds of rotating capital and making money Mr Warren Buffett cannot rotate money at all okay if he has to buy like a stock for example X stock for example I can buy noama well right and I bought noama well that is up like whatever 40 45% do you think that Mr Warren Buffett would even look at noama well he can not because he can buy like 100% of the company and would need to break a sweat so if he enters it he will be the owner of that company so he doesn't need all that headache okay so for him the yeah so bottom line is this that you know you have to fact check all these things and understand the difference between running like large ticket funds and small ticket funds for example when quant started quant mutual fund many of you would have invested small thought right it was small nimble it grew okay now it is big right and now generating growth is going to be challenging because the more growth you generate the harder the bigger your a u m gets the more money you have to manage and more money you have to manage the more headache it becomes for you okay always go back to this Mr Warren Buffett example everyone gets my to these two three points okay cool awesome so we'll start right so today what is it that we are going to study so very simple right so yesterday we had studied macro economics right here right today we are going to combine like these things right and we are going to do something called as fundamental analysis okay so we'll begin fundamental analysis right now I'll teach you the meaning of fundamental analysis but very quick discussion before that right about these blue questions okay for example one of the key questions that comes up in the market is that he US dollar is going to get replaced bricks currency is going to replace it gold is going to replace it Bitcoin is going to replace it so maybe like in 2025 I switch I should sell all my US denominated assets now what I US denominated assets US stocks I should sell okay if I have a house in US I should sell that US house okay I should not have any US dollar okay so is this like concern legitimate yes and no yes because US dollar is declining in value no doubt okay but at the same time economics is a very slow moving wheel okay it will take like decades for this to play out where dollar is not the primary store of wealth okay so here you need to go and understand the concept of store of wealth okay so what has happened is that see in the in like you know Mohinged are all her personalization what was the store of wealth the store of wealth was probably a lot okay for animal livestock it was artifacts right they were Paul's Pearl necklace and whatnot okay so that was the store of wealth in Mohinged are a part civilization in Aztec Egyptian civilization gold was the store of wealth okay then like I mean these are old times then we move to like 1900s okay early 1900s what was the store of wealth gold okay because pre 1920 everything was gold standard okay so gold plus silver standard and some countries move to gold some countries move to silver okay so it was primarily gold standard right then 1920 world war 1914 world war right and then to world war happened between 1914 and 1914 right and then basically the governments required a lot of money to fund these war because war is a waste it does not generate anything productive it just destroys things okay cities are eradicated decades of progress is eradicated etc etc and as a result government moved to fiat money what became the store of wealth always go back to this world so the store of wealth became government's words right that okay the government is saying that hey we are keeping $100 into our treasury worth of gold into our treasury right and storing it like in gold right that was gold standard so governments act that we don't need to do it just trust us okay we don't need to do it if anything happens we are there to save your ass okay so just trust us and this was called as fiat money or start of the fiat money okay fiat money so we moved from gold standard to a fiat standard when by 1973 okay so this transition was completed in 1973 of moving from gold to fiat okay and between 1930 and 1970 we were on and off gold standard for example during this phase US government seized gold from people okay why because it had to like you know fund war it was late to the war and all that why did US empire grew and right now like I mean since 1973 to 2025 what has been the number one winning advantage of US dollar or US it's the US dollar because they have been able to export their currency itself to the world yeah for example yesterday I explained the concept that a country truly grows rich if they export something of value for example when India was called the golden bird it used to export participated 25% of the world trade we were a net exporter okay so we were exporting things bringing foreign money into our nation we were exporting something when India was occupied by the Britishers what did Britishers used to do this government this government called it a British Raj so what they used to do was that they used to you know sort of grab like raw material from India take it to Manchester make sure it's sell it back in India okay so they used to do that right so again it was an export for them right that they were able to procure cheap material process it I'd value to it bring it back to Indians L.a.t.a or whatever right and that's how they used to export with okay for example in a railway line valley which is a facility from Indians right and whatever right and got it to like Manchester whatever so British Empire got stronger okay now that was 1800s 1900 what started happening US Empire started to gain strength why because they started exporting US dollar to the world now is that still happening yes even today as of 2025 almost 60 65% of the world trade happens in the US dollar okay so the natural question comes that will the US dollar get weekend over time yes but will it happen in our lifetime I don't know should you change your investment strategy in 3 to 5 years no should you think beyond that no okay so that's the more logical way of thinking about from an investing point of view about the chai pe chacha karni and all that stuff that's a separate argument altogether we can like all debate and you know sort of do that intellectual exercise but from an investing point of view nothing changes in terms of US dollar right for the next 3 to 5 years that's what I would say okay the change is fairly slow okay so this is right I hope this point is clear and it answers this question that will US dollar get the preplaced okay second key point is that you always need to go back to the question and this is something that I can't solve for you you need to have a clarity that what type of an investor you are okay so for example some people for example I have friends right and one friend only investment BTC okay Marama guys up right I'm only going to buy BTC that's it 100% of his investment is in BTC he does not own a house it does not own anything only BTC that's it okay so that's what he does right I have friends who only invest in every is okay I have friends who only buy real estate okay can I comment like I mean who is right who is wrong no because I don't know where the world will be in 5 years 10 years from now okay what type of an investor I am so I find most comfort in being diversified okay now how do I diversify I diversify using brain okay now what is the meaning of diversification for example if I feel that private banks are undervalued okay how to find the evaluation all that I'll explain today but let's assume that private banks are undervalued what will I do okay so I'll buy index also I'll buy HDFC bank also I'll bet codec bank also I'll buy IC IC I bank also I'll buy access also and I'm done okay and let's say if my budget is to invest like 10 lakhs in this theme then I'll put 2 to lakhs every and okay so that's what diversification for me is then I'll ask the next question that okay I'll be are it looks very undervalued no can I like you know do something else right so for example if I enter finance looks very undervalued okay so another example will be real estate and I am bullish I have been bullish on real estate I believe that it'
