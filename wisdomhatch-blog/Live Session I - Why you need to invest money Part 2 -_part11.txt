==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text is a transcript of a financial discussion covering various investment topics, including withdrawing funds during market downturns, moving money between countries (India, UAE, UK), investing in Bitcoin ETFs, diversification strategies, and critiques of instruments like NPS (National Pension System). The speaker advises against withdrawing during market lows, discusses tax advantages in UAE, warns against overexposure to single stocks, and compares investment options like NPS versus Nifty 50. The conversation also touches on macroeconomic indicators for emerging markets and diversification across asset classes.

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Market Timing and Withdrawals**: Withdrawing funds during a market downturn (e.g., 15% down) exacerbates losses; SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) may not make sense in such scenarios. Long-term holding (e.g., 2–4 years) can help recover losses.  
- **Cross-Border Investments**: Moving funds to UAE offers tax advantages (0% tax for residents) and higher real returns (~3% after inflation) compared to India (-3% real returns due to inflation and taxes).  
- **Diversification**: Avoid overexposure to single stocks (e.g., RSUs)—limit to 5–10% of the portfolio. Diversify within sectors (e.g., semiconductor index) to mitigate risk.  
- **Critique of NPS**: NPS returns (9–12%) underperform Nifty 50 after adjusting for fees and lock-ins (5+ years). Lack of flexibility and lower post-tax returns make it less attractive.  
- **Emerging Markets Investing**: Focus on asymmetric bets (undervalued growth opportunities) and diversify between emerging/developed markets. Avoid overlapping exposures (e.g., India + Bangladesh).  
- **Bitcoin ETFs**: Preference for pure Bitcoin ETFs over mixed-equity ones (e.g., Grayscale). Specific ETF recommendations were not provided but noted for follow-up.  
- **UK Real Estate Caution**: The UK economy is described as fragile post-Brexit, with high taxes and broken healthcare; investing there is discouraged.  
- **Hedging Strategies**: For concentrated stock positions (e.g., RSUs), use diversification instead of complex derivatives (e.g., F&O) to avoid monitoring burdens.  

### Additional Notes:
- The speaker emphasizes data-driven decisions (e.g., comparing NPS vs. Nifty) and simplicity (e.g., diversification over active hedging).  
- Age (44) and net worth (5cr) influence advice, favoring stable, tax-efficient strategies (e.g., UAE FDs).  
- Macro indicators for investing include growth potential, valuation (P/E ratios), and political stability.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
nd you invested 100 rupees now that is at 85 now because it is end of the year you will withdraw 4% more now you're withdrawing money in a market which is already 15% down so what sense does it make to do SIP this year yes right I got it but after considerably two years 30 year fourth year it may catch up the returns right might might not I cannot say that ITC did not come back up for 10 years that's my point okay very feeling very honored to speak with you thank you so much Arun Anketha Sandra yeah I actually in that order yeah Anketha and Sandra yeah yeah so I actually I have approximately 70 lakhs in my fidelity account and it's in the US and I was thinking of moving that money to real estate but currently my India plus US stock portfolio is approximately 15 lakhs should I target one hitting one crore first and then moving to do okay okay thank you so much idly right I mean unless you get a distress sale or something right yeah I'll share with Sandra here I'm 44 and I would not say that I'm very financially not eligible also and neither I have the inclination to spend a lot of time on that okay so given my age and my net worth is around 5cr also you think it's a good move to open offshore account and move some funds even if it is for emptying in dirhams yes it is yes yes yes yes it's not as if that you need to spend too much time UAE you are making like 4.75 if you are a UA tax resident then taxes 0 inflation is 2 so real wealth growth is almost 3% on FD's risk-free right in India that's minus 3% so there is a delta of 5% right between investing in UAE versus India because of taxation and inflation any idea on the taxation if I'm an Indian tax resident with this so any every that you do Indian government is going to you know put whatever taxes they're generally charged here okay thank you yeah um Kanchan Suleesh hi hi Akshad so you answered my question on bitcoin ETF but can you suggest any specific ETF that we should go for for investing in bitcoins because I know I I mean I actively invest in bitcoin waste through wasted but it also has exposure to a lot of equity in terms of the companies that have exposure to bitcoins right but if I want to or pure bitcoins how how to invest in or on I'll search for the ETF exactly ETF and Lekyan okay in the community yeah I'll write a note okay sure all right uh solution I don't uh um so I'm I'm uh living in the UK uh I have a job at only house here um so if I get a chance to move to UAE um so what should you say Sudeh sell my house or rent it as an investment and just worry about what you said about you get I don't know man I mean selling a house buying a house in UK is not my area of expertise I'll not comment too much on it and I can just generally tell you that you know because UK has a series of problems it kind of doesn't make sense so the the the the economy is like on a slippery track okay that's how I'll put it right uh doesn't make sense I mean why would like UK grow right and the entire Brexit was an item where labor party government is not you know sort of creating any bullish sentiment in UK people are fleeing UK uh half of UAE like I'm in a big chunk of UK has moved to UAE taxes already very high health care is broken right doesn't add up right now it's not sensible to like sort of you know bet on investments in UK even if you're living in UK you might like living in UK might be a great place for lifestyles but from investing it might not make sense there should be some trigger of growth right I mean for example the India growth story is not IT or anything it's just population growth okay so as population grow the GDP will grow automatically because of that's not we don't require any genius to do anything okay so that's at least India story you US China at least tech is there they're innovating they have research capital what is UK doing right so I mean their population is shrinking they don't have any good political structure the the um yes that's how I put it thank you nice talk to you yeah actually would be taking some hedging strategies like for example I hold a lot of my company stocks in RSUs recently when the deep seek news came I could say a lot of well slowing away so any emerging strategy will be over with broad call okay so it's like one of my stocks also and so like hopefully it's our wives right so what any is I might see a hedging strategy is very simple don't invest more than 5% of your capital on any single stock that's like diversification basics of diversification when I teach like portfolio building I'll cover that also but to cut the long story short even if you're working with broadcom and you understand the company really well don't have more than 10% exposure so just diversify within the same segment right I mean it might make sense for you to buy like semiconductor index and like you know diversify a little bit there okay my question is like this fn on options or anything like that will help in such a short how big is the portfolio actually significant of my salary comes from that stocks problem that happens is the moment you get into fno you have to reposition at xpd which requires constant monitoring there what is a little bit complicated nice therefore the easiest way to hedges diversification within your asset class so don't have more than like 10% exposure of broadcom to begin with so that requires less monitoring now you're in a day job might not be able to like you know if there is a significant moment your stop loss doesn't get triggered then you this massive loss that you can take even on like derivatives right so yeah okay thank you yeah um concussion yes it is to add out to my bitcoin question on vested there are certain other investment instruments like grayscale bitcon cash draw stand grayscale bitcon mini trust so if while you are writing the note if you can give some some more information about what are those and does investing into those instruments make sense that would also help i'll do thanks yeah so i wanted to ask like i did not completely understand why you are saying pf e pf and maybe nps is not good because what i know is it is not taxable if you keep it for more than five years okay and someone said already that in ps can give us a better return because in ps we can choose the we can choose the which in which category you want to invest in you in in ps you can like risky category and low risk and so so that option is there for us okay so here is the data right and so that claim is incorrect right to begin with so here is like and again like public city is like a life saver okay so here is how much returns nps gives so the range is 9 to 12 percent yes so this is what it gives right analyzed over the years right so it's not 12 12 percent is for risky category now the benchmark you cannot compare it that 12 percent return to nifty 50 okay this 12 percent will include like i don't know what okay so and it kind of makes structural sense also right i mean here the pension fund is managing your money so they will do it more conservatively their focus is not wealth erosion and moreover you are paying money to pension fund manager or free for the money right so they are going to charge you some money so like 12 percent on nifty is equal to 10 percent on nps so even if you adjust for tax it's net net the same plus there is zero flexibility on nps because minimum lock in is 5 years on nifty 50 there is no lock in for example you buy nifty 50 now in 5 years it will cut at speed and you are able to at least capture 20 percent returns and you can rotate that capital therefore it doesn't make any sense to lock your capital on a 10 year basis and so it's like what do you think it is so there is no point in like you know sort of investing in nps and making less return than nifty 50 so that's what math tells us and that's what even like you know even check the rate also yes yes yes hello akshad I wanted to ask you when you want to invest in newer economies new countries what are we co-5 important macro economic indicators we want to you know we want to look at so that we can filter out here so this is like a good economy to invest I mean we could even invest in even in Bangladesh like what are stopping us from doing that see number one is that you need to buy for kid between like emerging markets and emerged markets right so for example that's a very clear bifurcation because it gives you diversification okay for example should all of us invest in India in one emerging market and one emerging market the answer is yes yeah now the second that's layer one right so for example it makes zero sense to invest in India and Bangladesh and Nepal and like you know Sri Lanka all because they are all emerging marketplace okay that's point one right so second diversification is that you must understand that you can are you taking some asymmetric bits asymmetric bit means that something which is which has a chance of growth but it is not as overvalued for example UA stock market right E-MAR which is one of the top builders in UA which has built Dubai mall push Khalifa that trades at a P multiple of 10 but the money enterprise which is again an infrastructure company one could argue trades at a P multiple of 50 so like where is asymmetric bit right so I mean you invest in E-MAR sit for like next 30 years there will be a phase when E-MAR will might have a P of 30 who knows right so that's a 3x multiplication automatically okay so yeah so I mean that's how I'll look at things where there are options but it's a more complicated topic so I'll not be able to like just do a Q&A but hopefully like I'm in after the session it might make no sense after the all the classes it might make no sense yeah all right Namesh yes yes my question is similar to one of the questions that was asked earlier so most of my savings are in RSUs from my company and some in cash about 60% in RSUs and around 40% in cash and I want to diversify so what should be like th
