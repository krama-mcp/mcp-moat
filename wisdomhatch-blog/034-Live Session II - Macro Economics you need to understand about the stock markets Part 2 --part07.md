==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text is a fragmented, conversational discussion about investment strategies, market analysis, and personal finance. The speaker critiques systematic investment plans (SIPs) for lacking exit timing, advocates for market-timing strategies (buying undervalued assets, selling overvalued ones), and dismisses India's AI growth potential. Other topics include gold as a stagnant asset, taxation, cryptocurrency, and passive investment alternatives like index funds. The speaker emphasizes practical trading over SIPs and hints at teaching fundamental analysis in future sessions.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
1. **Critique of SIPs**: SIPs (dollar-cost averaging) are flawed because they lack clear exit strategies and may lead to buying overvalued assets, reducing long-term returns.  
2. **Market Timing**: Profitable investing requires buying in undervalued markets and selling in overvalued ones ("bulk buying" and partial selling).  
3. **Gold as a Safe but Slow Asset**: Gold is not a growth asset; recent surges may lead to corrections, with expected low long-term returns (~3–5% CAGR).  
4. **India’s AI and Crypto Lag**: The speaker is pessimistic about India’s AI innovation and crypto ecosystem, citing limited development and regulatory hurdles.  
5. **Taxation and Practical Tips**: Filing equity taxes is straightforward via broker statements; the speaker prefers UAE FDs for liquidity and tax efficiency.  
6. **Active Capital Rotation**: Rapid capital rotation between sectors (e.g., tech rallies) can outperform SIPs but requires skill and timing.  
7. **Fed Policy Influence**: Global markets often mirror U.S. Fed decisions; tracking Fed meetings (via summaries) is crucial for macro trends.  
8. **Sector Preferences**: Two-wheeler automotive stocks (Hero, Bajaj) are favored; NASDAQ and Nifty are mentioned for bulk investments.  
9. **Emergency Funds**: Liquid funds or UAE FDs are recommended for safety and liquidity over growth-focused instruments.  
10. **Efficient Market Hypothesis**: News (e.g., tariffs) is quickly priced into markets, making reactive trading ineffective.  

**Additional Notes**: The tone is candid and opinionated, with a focus on active management over passive strategies. The speaker plans to cover fundamental analysis (e.g., ratios, stock movements) in subsequent sessions.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ay. I don't read business newspapers or any newspaper. Okay. So it's useless. Okay. Basically, you have to do second order analysis, which I'll teach you. What do you think of speculative stocks like Adani, not very highly. You already know that right? So like that's how to say. What do you think about DCA as a start? That's dollar cost app averaging that's SIP. Okay. The problem with SIP is that see it's you don't know when to exit. Where will you exit and if you're never exiting, then you are just eventually it's like you will take the hits someday. It may be like 20 years on the line. I don't know. So point is that see when the market is clearly overvalued sell some when the market is clearly undervalued bulk. Why? Okay. That's when you will make real money. Yes. So what's up group is already active. So I think people have joined it also. So please check your emails. Please drop us our email in case you haven't been added. We have not posted anything yet. So we'll start posting it from Monday to use it. Right. So that's when we'll make it active and it will be active for one year. Okay. So all the moves that I'm making in the market. I'll let you. Okay. Innovation growth in AI India not at all. Right. Is that an area of growth USNFR? Do you see us? I think not at all. Right. I'm being blunt with you. Right. So I don't think and anyone working in AI will confirm that right. We are far. We are done. Right. No one wants to build any cryptos and all that in India anymore. Right. We have three cryptos. The action is way too much right. Why would you build? Yeah. Will you sell gold if it may go up in time? No. See, I mean gold is not like a growth asset anymore for me. Right. I mean, because the narrative has been so positive on gold now that, you know, it's like yeah, lot of run up has happened. Right. And in a very short span of time. So now the chances of side risk correction is way high. Gold does not correct too much in value, which is a good news. So it's not as if that you will lose your principle if you're investing. But it could happen that you know over the next 10 years basis, it will only give like maybe three, four percent five percent run up something like this on CGR basis. Handling taxation while buying it, it's very easy to file taxes on your equity. Just download it from your broker's account. Whichever app you're using and they give you a tax PNL. So you just have to show it to your CEO. Okay. Bank charges over the. They'll get back. They give lower. Okay, how do you nothing one? It's like prize of corruption. This is nothing that can be done. Okay. So when you say you are invested 75% video positive remaining FDs. Okay. So for the timing. SIP compounding concept actually works. Okay. SIP compounding makes one crore into 10 crore. But inflation compounding makes the value of that 10 crore back to 1.5 crore. Okay. So effectively you make like 50 likes. Because that's how you need to look at it. Okay. Swing credit. Yes, you will learn. Basics. Okay. So if you invest in US dollar. Do we get the same? In a bit. From other Middle East countries except UAE. I think so. You should be getting it. That will also be yes. Yes. That's wisdom. Community also you will be added to WhatsApp group. So you can either access like wisdom. Ach group on website. Right. Or WhatsApp both are fine. I see I see a long barred. I already have it in my portfolio. I bought it early so I don't know. I have not realized it. Is it the right time to buy what? Okay. So like for example, NASDAQ bulk. I don't know. Okay. But Indian. Nifty bulk one can be done. Okay. HDFC and see what I've been doing. I think I might see I'm not against SIP right. SIP works for some kind of investors. I feel that you can do a better job than a SIP right. That's what I'm hinting towards. Okay. If you're not in the same method then continue SIP. It's not as if that you lose money or something. Currently 30% loss 50% position book that loss and reinvest. But I nearly says, okay. I could not understand the question fully. If you can speak maybe right. I'll let you speak. Emergency funds and FD or liquid funds see I park it in UAE FD because it's net positive for me. Right. I have that option. Therefore I'm able to do it. India may I used to park it in liquid debt fund. Right. So that's what I used to do. We keep buying and selling index equity in lesson one year. I won't say see it is there and you cannot change that right. But still think about it this way that if you're able to rotate capital twice. Then your profits could potentially become like 30% CGR. So you're paying profits on taxes or sorry you're paying taxes on profits right. If you're a UAE tax or it is a part of one UA menu. Right. So I mean they don't do all this like a TCS collector. You just do like that. So says like that. They don't so there is no such thing like this. Right. You can directly buy. P O V on automotive's automobile sector. I'm only buying two wheelers. That's it. Right. So two that is what was it hero motor and bajaj auto. So yeah. Users to invest FD by some years of Madhkar. Right. If you're investing in FD just buy a gold ticket FD and keep money safe. That's the entire idea. For example, the utility of an FD is for example, how much differential will you wait on your FD? If you invest like best deal in the market. Versus HDFC or blue chip company maybe one one and a half percent. Right. Now if you are there is no point in taking like principal risk on all this. Okay. It's not you're not investing in an FD for growth. You're investing in FD for liquidation that you can liquidate. For example, today market is 10 15% down. Whatever FD money you don't need for the next two three years, Dalfi, sure though. Right. That is a 10% add on which will definitely add on our three or four year basis. Very high probability. Which is a three percent alpha over the market. You're getting right to off-math. I'm telling you. Can we monitor whether the government is pursuing QE? See. You can for example, whatever decision US feds take other countries typically copy. Right. Yeah. So that's what I would say. So for that you have to read the read the fed minutes. Right. So they come out do a policy meeting every three months where they decide whether to increase like interest rate, decrease interest rate. So that is called as Fed meeting. So just go to public city and ask summarize. Can you summarize like Fed meeting for me. So that's for flexibility will do that job for you and you're done. Right. So you don't need to read any articles and all that. Okay. I don't read anything. Now I only read for a flexibility. That's it. Okay. So are you. As you are not able to manage portfolio for Indian as a chance. Can you recommend some good people for international investing? No. Okay. Then it becomes my responsibility. If they will be lost for you, then it's a problem. Okay. Sensible and 50 yes. It is sensible. Do like maybe 60% 65%. Definitely. Right. I mean 70% up. Invest. I mean at the stage. There is no harm. Okay. So you will make money. Awesome. Paul. Basil. Hi action. I just want. Sorry. Paul. You want to talk? I can't hear you. Hello. Can you hear me? I can't hear you also. There are a problem. I'm not sure. One minute. Hello. You are building. You said you are done 20 30%. I think rest of the money isn't cash or have the yes correct. Right. So we can. You know, I. I cannot. We can hear you. Okay. One minute. Okay. All right. Now I can. I should be able to hear. Basil. And then Paul. Yes. Akshad. Is there any chance of. Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Okay. Let's try once. Can you hear me? Yeah. Is there any chance of market correction? Yes. Okay. Is there any chance of market correction? Yes. Is there any chance of market correction? Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes.гаcore practical bettaweet loss and tax increase of. Market correction post April second. This this year. Post tariff implemented by. Like, because of tariff. No. That is already being factored into it. That concept is called as efficient market hypothesis. A. Thump has already announced that he's going to. And you know, sort of put tariffs. that has been factored that news has factored into the market. thats the market. So market will not fall because of this news, okay. discussion. I've already shown you what I'm going to teach tomorrow right in the morning class. So just look at it once tomorrow most specifically like I mean I'll talk about like you know the fundamental analysis right and I'll talk about like the ratios all that stuff so that will be the agenda for tomorrow right and mostly like how do stocks move and why do stocks move right so that's the idea tomorrow okay any specific Southeast Asia stop market you are studying Malaysia seems good but I don't I have not made any indispensable right same. So Ganya okay Paul yes Paul and Suga. Thanks. Good evening. I'm a audible. Yeah yeah yeah actually how I have understood this SAP versus capital rotation is that say for example I'm a audible. Yeah yeah yeah yeah if you're running SAP periodically for particularly for a long period of time getting a return over casual for 12% in an index fund it is way more better than rotating the capital in the stock particularly for any particular stock if a meta run up around 100% or 50% we can take money and we can rotate that money into another rally another set of sector rally like that you are saying right. I understand like this from your viewpoint that you are saying this thing against SAP. No so SIP problem is two problems right one is that you don't know when to exit because you are SIP and which simply means that you are buying at whatever levels and never exiting okay that's problem one problem to is that you are buying even when the market is over valued or clearly over valued okay so that's the issue with SIP and therefore your returns will be lower that's the headache okay but if you still want to
