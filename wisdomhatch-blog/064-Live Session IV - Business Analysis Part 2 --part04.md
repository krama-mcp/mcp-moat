SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses investment strategies, emphasizing the importance of understanding market cycles, accessibility of information, and risk tolerance. They highlight that retail investors can compete with large investors in macro moves (like timing rate cuts) but not in micro-analysis (e.g., individual stocks like Apple). They debunk the idea of easily identifying "multi-bagger" stocks but suggest small-cap monopolies as potential candidates. The speaker advises buying fairly valued assets like the Nifty 50 index and warns against tax-inefficient investments (e.g., bonds). They stress sentiment analysis (e.g., buying when markets are bearish) and advocate for a diversified, risk-adjusted portfolio. Personal risk appetite, influenced by one's financial background, is key to decision-making. Technical analysis and fundamental checks (e.g., no red flags) are also noted as critical tools.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Market Cycles Matter:** Focus on timing macro cycles (e.g., Fed rate cuts) where retail and institutional investors have equal information access.  
- **Avoid "Multi-Bagger" Hype:** No guaranteed multi-baggers, but small-cap monopolies (e.g., niche businesses) may offer growth potential.  
- **Index Funds as Safe Bets:** Nifty 50 is a fairly valued, low-risk entry point for beginners, especially after corrections.  
- **Sentiment-Driven Opportunities:** Buy assets when sentiment is negative (e.g., Indian stocks during bearish phases) and avoid overhyped ones (e.g., gold).  
- **Risk Appetite is Personal:** Wealth origin (self-made vs. generational) shapes risk tolerance—align investments accordingly.  
- **Tax Efficiency Matters:** Avoid structurally tax-inefficient products (e.g., bonds taxed at slab rates).  
- **Diversification and Analysis:** Combine fundamental checks (18-point checklist), technical analysis (RSI, support/resistance), and sentiment to judge assets.  
- **Realistic Returns:** Aim for 13–20% CAGR; higher returns require exceptional strategy or luck.  
- **Self-Reliance in Research:** Learn to analyze stocks independently instead of relying on stock-specific tips.  
- **Homework and Discipline:** Follow structured learning (videos, spreadsheets) and avoid impulsive bets (e.g., individual stock picks without analysis).

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ght now. US stocks might be in an up cycle here. So this is a buy market. This is probably a sell market. I'm not issuing recommendation. I'm just telling you, okay. They will also go through their cycle. They will also go through their cycle. Same about Bitcoin. Bitcoin might be somewhere here. So our job is to figure out the right cycle to invest in because here we have same access to information as large ticket investments. Okay. You might have heard that's your retail investors. They lose money because they try to compete with big guys. Okay. So do you know, you know, if Mr. Warren Buffett knows what's happening at Apple more than you and I. Yes. Because if he calls Tim Cook, Tim Cook will pick up his phone. But if Akshad calls a product manager at Apple, he will not even speak with me. Probably. Okay. So that's the difference. Access to information is different for Mr. Warren Buffett and me on Apple's top. But does Mr. Warren Buffett know that Fed chairman is going to cut rates tomorrow? No, because if Fed chairman is caught talking to Mr. Warren Buffett, both of them will go to jail for insider trading. Okay. We cannot do that. Okay. So point being that if you are making macro moves, trying to time the cycle. Okay. That's sensible for retail investors because both Mr. Warren Buffett and I have equal access to information. Okay. But when it comes to these micro things, right. Okay. Apple, you know, some media and all that stuff. So that is not something that, you know, anyone can stop per se. Okay. So yeah, so that's the bottom line. I hope that you got this. Okay. So there is no such thing as multi-bagger. Okay. Multi-bagger means that you buy a piti, piti, p stock, poly company. For example, Motira Lozwal is at 8 p. And if for some reason, it goes to 8 p. That's 10x in your money. Okay. At like same earning level and on top of that, if EPS also expands, then the company is going to do fabulously well and becomes a multi-bagger. So that is the story of a multi-bagger. No one can tell what a multi-bagger is. Okay. You just start experimenting with a range of stocks, but yes, there are certain features. For example, you should buy a small cap company if you are trying to figure out multi-baggers. You buy like monopolis, small cap monopolis. For example, dream folks is a small cap monopoli. PBR is a small cap monopoli. Okay. If that business itself grows, for example, if PBR starts an India version of Netflix or whatever, right? I mean, that's a business that no one saw. Okay. They started, they excelled all that stuff. Right. So these are potential monopolis. One could argue. No, I'm a wealth. It's a small cap, 10,000, 15,000 crore company. It can go to 100,000 crores. What will happen to your stock? It will go to next. Right. So that's the idea then. Right. So I hope that these points are now making sense. Okay. Please advise CMP of nifty, 50, nifty, 50 is a good asset to buy. It's fairly valued. That's what I would say. Okay. Is there a different logic based on your size of networks for limiting small or mid cap exposure? See, I don't consider small and mid cap. I just consider investment as investment. If I'm getting a great deal in Dubai, I'll buy it. If I'm getting a great deal in Goa, I'll buy it. If I'm getting a great deal on large cap, I'll buy it. If I'm getting a good deal on small cap, I'll buy it. By nature, I was slightly risked over the investor. Now, which I look very random to you. Right. You are risk averse. Right. So then who is like a pun trust. Right. So I am risk averse for me because I have built my own wealth. I was not 100 like generational wealth. So I'm a little bit more conservative. I meet a lot of my friends who have who are like multi-multi-millionaire on dad's money. They have entirely different risk appetite. Okay. Then me. Me. Me. Nature. Me. Right. So I mean, I cannot go against my nature. Okay. So that's another important aspect to understand. That principle loss is okay. Right. I mean, what's the thing in investing? Sometimes you can't change that. But the extent of risk that I take with my investments is not that high. Okay. So for example, even when I'm doing angel investing, I'll properly study the company, all that stuff. You can still lose it. Right. But I am despite like having a large portfolio, I still behave like our normal retail investor, who is risk averse. Okay. Because I have done jobs. I have worked like 16, 16, 17, 17 hours a day at like BCG Dalbo because it's not as if I was 100 year like, Mosaic or Overtime. So the point is that I know the pain of losing money. Right. So that has not left me right for some reason. Right. Which is good also. Right. So I hope that this point is clear. Right. And okay. Portfolio building we will pick next week. Right. So we'll do fundamental analysis. Portfolio building went to sell US stock investing. These are four or five classes left. Right. And I'll put it all together. Right. Just very quickly. Right. I'll just want to cover like the final points from this slide. Technical. Yes. Yes. So technical I'm already teaching you. So for example, two is to one trade. I'll teach MSID RSI. So it's a 770. You'll go. Right. So I will cover this. Right. Now see, basically like if you're judging the asset quality, if it is fundamentally good, I'll give you 18 point less next week. Right. If the company has no major red flags, for example, Tata Motors we discussed, the major red flag is that we don't know if it will be competitive in five years. Okay. No major overvaluation. For example, just say if you study CDSL camps, one could argue that it is overvalued. Right. Technical analysis makes sense. Technical analysis we learn. Sentiment analysis is very good. Okay. So for example, right now, gold is in very positive sentiment. Should you bulk by gold? No. Okay. What is in a bad sentiment right now? Indian stock market is in a bad sentiment. Okay. That, you know, are quick pilser at that Twitter period, they were say, we've been doing all that stuff. So which means what? That you should probably buy like Indian stock market, right? When people become bearish on US stocks, then we buy more of US stocks. Okay. So I hope that this point is clear to everyone. But yes, sentiment is not that you should buy like tax ineffective things. For example, bonds are generally tax ineffective most of the bonds. Okay. In India because bonds are taxed at slab dividends are taxed at slab. So that's structurally bad. So structurally bad products, we should always eliminate from our portfolio as much as possible. So yesterday we spoke about PF, EPS, NPS, all that stuff. I covered it in the morning also with that question itself. Right. So always fact check these things. Long term name, what is a good gain to make if your if your portfolio is growing at 13, 14% you're doing a good job. Okay. That's a good decent job. Right. Without you losing too much commission. If it is growing at 18, 19, 20% C.L. Gear, it's very good. So usually like my portfolio, I'm able to grow at around 20% right, which I'm very happy with. Just for example, mutual fund coming when I did. So this was at C.L. Gear of like 30, right, at few days back, over a few months back with the other, because the market itself fell by 15% right. Otherwise here it would have been higher. Right. How do I unlisted stocks? I'll write a note. Right. So you can use incorrect money. What I will do tomorrow is that I'll send you some homework to just view. There are four or five videos. Please watch that. Right. I'll share some class notes. These Excel spreadsheets, everything. Right. I'll share that. Third, I'll send you like a question, submission link. Okay. So whatever questions you have, you just send it to me. I'll, it's on slide. Okay. So whatever the up-booted questions are, I will either write a response to that or come like 15 minutes before and send it. So I will send all this on WhatsApp. Okay. So WhatsApp group that we have created. If you have not been added to that group, please get added. These were two very tiring days. So, you know, we'll just end the class here. Right. So, but hopefully you enjoyed. Right. You learn something new. That's the idea. Right. And yeah. And we'll meet next week. Please complete the homework. What I'm sending you. Okay. Okay. A take. Let me take some questions. Okay. What portfolio should be the, in what percent of it should be the index one? See, index funds comes under stock market investment. Okay. So for example, it's like saying that what percentage of my networks should be on land. Okay. It's not like that. What percentage of your networks should be in real estate? That's the right question to ask. So index is a type of a or like stock is a type of an app. So when it comes under stock markets. Okay. Now, for example, right now if you're just starting, okay. And if it is your step one, is tomorrow a great time to buy index. Yes. Okay. Why? Because the chances of you losing money on it is very less. Okay. Why? Because you're buying a price correction of 10, 11 percent, 12 percent. Right. Portfolio building. Yes. We will discuss. Right. Will you be sharing a link to purchase? NSES. I'll do that. Not a problem. Nipon ETFVs. Yes. Technicals. More on technical. I'll continue doing that. Right. So support resistance. Band theory. I'm going to get a call. India. Please don't ask me like individual stock. He has stock analyze. The whole stock analyze. I'm already teaching you how to do it. Right. So please do it yourself. Right. So I mean, that's the idea of the course. Otherwise, there are like so many stocks to analyze how many land. Right. So that's the idea. Any thoughts of investing in bonds? See, as a structured product, it doesn't make much sense to me anymore. Right. Or bond investing in India. Because as I said that because Indian government banned its own notes itself. So there is no like G6. S a query. Parchi. Any I in our depreciation in one year.
