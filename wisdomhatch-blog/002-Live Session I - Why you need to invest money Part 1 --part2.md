SUMMARY:
The speaker discusses the importance of understanding investment fees, particularly the difference between regular and direct mutual fund plans, emphasizing how high commissions can significantly erode long-term returns. They provide a mathematical example showing how a 1% fee difference can reduce portfolio gains by 33% over 40 years. The talk also outlines an investment course structure covering macroeconomics, fundamental/technical analysis, and personal finance, with a focus on practical arbitrage strategies like switching to direct funds, avoiding overvalued assets, and tax optimization.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. **Regular vs. Direct Mutual Funds**:  
   - Regular plans charge commissions (0.3–2%), reducing returns, while direct plans eliminate intermediary fees.  
   - Switching to direct funds can save up to 30–40% of portfolio value over time.  

2. **Impact of Fees on Long-Term Wealth**:  
   - A 1% higher fee (e.g., 12% vs. 13% returns) can lead to an 8 crore deficit on a 25,000/month SIP over 40 years.  
   - Compounded fees are "poison" to wealth-building.  

3. **Arbitrage Strategies for Investors**:  
   - **Beginners**: Move from regular to direct mutual funds.  
   - **Intermediate**: Avoid overvalued assets and learn capital rotation.  
   - **High Net Worth**: Relocate to low capital gains tax jurisdictions for tax efficiency.  

4. **Investment Course Structure**:  
   - Covers macroeconomics (interest rates, QE), fundamental/technical analysis (ratios, candlestick patterns), and business/industry analysis.  
   - Emphasizes practical, actionable insights over theoretical depth.  

5. **Broader Financial Awareness**:  
   - Highlights hidden fees in FX conversions (e.g., Indian banks charge ~1% for international transfers).  
   - Stresses benchmarking mutual funds against relevant indices (e.g., Nifty 50 for large-cap funds).  

6. **Course Delivery**:  
   - Fast-paced, with recordings available post-session.  
   - Community access (WhatsApp) for ongoing support and actionable updates.  

*Note*: The speaker’s tone is informal, with tangents (e.g., FX fees, technical issues), but core lessons are data-driven and focused on fee minimization and strategic investing.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
like regularly right and we are just starting out of portfolio fair enough right so let's move to talking about point two right so interim stage right or intermediate stage or new stage okay now at new stage I will tell you my story so when I started investing right I was in a full time job at a demanding consulting firm so I did not have like you know time okay so my my mutual fund advisor right and I my mom said that he want to invest in like mutual fund right I would say if this that's up okay so I spoke with like a mutual fund agent right I mean he was a family friend he suggested me like these four five plants okay and I invested via something called as regular plans okay now for every mutual fund that is something called as regular and direct plans okay now regular plans are and we don't understand the difference right because we are starting out we don't know like you know what the regular direct there's that there are like you know four thousand mutual funds right that's planned this okay so if I'm okay fine I'll put it in like regular so now then over time I realize that if you put money in regular plans in mutual funds you will end up losing crazy amount of commissions okay and it's not as if that you're getting any additional advantage it's just that you're paying more commissions now then natural question comes that okay how much commissions am I paying maybe like 0.2% 0.3% 0.5% or I might if I'm having like a very good job I might give my money to PMS guys right and there I'm paying 2% of AUM so natural question comes for newbies is that how to invest if the only thing that you take away from the courses that how can I save my commissions okay saving commissions can actually save 30 40% of your portfolio okay now this is a mathematics that again no one will tell you okay so let's run through that mathematics and let me show it to you so that it gives you like a little bit of more sense okay so for example and this is like a computation that you can do on your own so for example if you're running an SIP of 25,000 to piece on monthly basis okay and let's say that you're 20 25 you will at least invest it like 45 so we can make this 40s okay now PMS guys for example Sauramukharji in the likes they take 2% of AUM okay and they are under performing the market right similarly mutual funds can charge somewhere between you know 0.3 to like 1 1 and a half percent also okay so let's say and I'm not picking and I'm making a general case so studies tell us that 85% of money managers beat PMS beat mutual fund guys they do not beat the benchmark now what is the meaning of benchmark benchmark means means that if you're considering nifty 50 now this is the collection of top 50 or top 50 large cap companies in India these would be ITCH, DFC, Bank all that stuff so the benchmark is nifty 50 for a large cap fund okay large cap but for a small cap fund for example there is something called as quant small cap fund right now you'll see that okay the CAGR is 25% for that quant small cap fund but is the benchmark nifty 50 there no because quant small cap small cap means that these are not nifty 50 or top 50 companies these are smaller companies okay so there the benchmark would be what the benchmark would be small cap 250 index okay so that is the relevant benchmark so if you compare the relevant benchmark let's say let's compare like large cap to large cap then mutual fund guys or PMS guys might only generate like 12% okay so nifty on an average generates like 12 and a half so let's look at the difference okay so let me just quickly I'm the mathematics and then we'll dive deeper into it and I'm just showing you the power of commissions okay how much it actually impacts your portfolio even small small numbers compounded over 40 years so if you're doing it 12% okay so you make 25 roughly 24.5 CR okay now all I'm changing is like 13% right so if you do it without commission so this is 32.5 so 24.5 minus 32.5 it's 8 crore on a base of 24.5 so that is one third so how much is the portfolio change it's 33% on a 1% commission difference okay so 33% this is the difference between traveling like economy class versus business class or business class versus first class okay consistently okay so people just think that it's like 1% commission or 0.5% commission or 0.1% commission commission is poison okay in in in this okay now this works at multiple levels okay so for example Indian banks are the most crooked banks out there right I don't know Africa or something but that might be different but honestly if you do FX right so for example if you're own taxed money you are trying to send it to Dubai right like our whichever country you want to move okay my voice is okay right just give me a second guys okay just a minute please don't start like any boards and all right so just a minute I'm just quickly checking if everyone is able to join the class okay okay my voice is clear no not a problem okay all right okay so I'm just checking if everyone is able to join I'm just message my team okay so for example Indian banks right the FX conversion for example if you do any conversion from let's say ADCV Abu Dhabi commercial bank in UAE and try to send money in India the FX rate remains the same whatever is Google showing you okay but if you do the opposite that you send money from HDFC to DRAM account right here it's they will charge you like 1% commission on that money also okay so it's like crazy anyways the idea is not to crib but to show you orbit charges okay so coming back to the chart that I had drawn right so you see I can bring back it got evaporated okay so if you are like a yeah so if you are number one like start starter or intermittent level so start may the arbitrage is that you simply move from regular funds to direct okay that's a very simple hack of saving a lot of money if you are intermediate right then the only thing two things that you can do one is that don't buy overvalued things and number two rotate capital if you can run these learn these two things rotate capital yeah you will make a lot of money okay number three if you are sitting on a portfolio of 3CR plus and if you move to a low capital gains gains tax country you will save crazy amount of money over time okay that's these are three points that are arbitrage oriented points this has got nothing to do with investing but add at the same time this has got to do a lot of things to do with investing okay these are points because what what ends up happening is that for example if you start investing in mutual fund then you get logged into it it becomes very difficult to take out money right even from a regular to direct because you will think that okay is the market right what if I miss the rally all that's right so I'll speak about how to move money also from one type of mutual fund to the next but I hope that these three points are clear to everyone right that where the arbitrage is very simple and this is the ROI of the course okay so I hope I was able to help you save money and give you a clarity on where the course is headed now just helping you understand the overall structure of the course right and this is what the course structure looks like what we are going to cover right so class one and two today we will study macro economics right this is part one right and let me just draw it for you first okay so basically like in investing there are three or four key parts okay the first key part is something called as personal finance okay now this is something that you might watch a lot of videos so I don't teach too much personal finance because this is personal in nature I can't teach you much but I can tell you some basics which I will tell along the way so there is no dedicated class on personal finance second part is that you understand something called as macro level analysis now here you need to know the basics of economics like what is interest rate what is liquidity what is quantitative easing quantitative tightening now if I give you homework that read like 50 lectures of 50 books you'll go mad right I mean those are like you know core macro economics and your head will spend so I'll try to explain this part in very easy to understand language otherwise this is a course in itself in India schools okay third part is called as fundamental analysis so you look at like company balance sheet you look at like p ratio p b ratio all that there are 100 different ratios now people try to become like accountants here okay that okay if we start learning about p ratio then we need to know about peg ratio also we need to know about p to b ratio also we need to look at like you know market cap to gdp ratio also so there is no end to all this okay so how to like you know be a broad broad person okay so this is the third layer of analysis fourth is called as technical analysis yes technical analysis for example we look at candlestick patterns right so for example if I have to quickly show you so here you will see red and green candles so how to analyze all this right is this a good time to enter right this asset called as an empty bank index so I'll teach you technical analysis okay and then finally like business analysis is another key concept so fundamental analysis business analysis industry analysis technical analysis and personal finance so these are like four five key topics and macro analysis so these five six topics are key topics that we will cover over the next four days okay cool so this is going to be a power packed course it might be a little bit fast-paced I cannot write I mean I'll teach fast only okay so hopefully it will add like a lot of value right so in case you guys miss the recordings will be up right in 24 to 36 hours so you can watch it during the week also okay and that's part one so once these four days are done you'll be added to the community on whatsapp right so where I will write detailed posts on whatever actions I am taking in terms of inv
