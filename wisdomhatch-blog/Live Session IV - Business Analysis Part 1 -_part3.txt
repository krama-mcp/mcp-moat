SUMMARY:
The text discusses investment strategies, emphasizing the importance of buying stocks with a "margin of safety" through price or time corrections. It contrasts chasing overvalued stocks ("growth assets") with value investing, where investors wait for corrections in price or time (stagnation) before buying. The author provides examples like Access Bank and HDFC to illustrate how stocks can stagnate for years despite strong fundamentals, highlighting the risks of buying at high valuations without corrections. The note also differentiates between large-cap and small-cap stocks, explaining that smaller companies can justify higher P/E ratios due to faster growth potential. Lastly, the importance of having an exit strategy (capital rotation or stop-loss) is emphasized.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
1. **Margin of Safety**: Avoid buying stocks at 0% margin of safety (overvalued); instead, wait for price or time corrections.  
2. **Price vs. Time Correction**:  
   - *Price correction*: The stock price drops significantly.  
   - *Time correction*: The stock stagnates for years despite growth in fundamentals (e.g., HDFC trading flat for 4 years).  
3. **Value Investing Principle**: Buy growing assets (or industries growing faster than GDP) after a correction (price, time, or both).  
4. **Avoid Sentiment-Driven Investing**: Example: Gold may have bullish sentiment but lacks corrections; invest cautiously.  
5. **Small-Cap vs. Large-Cap Dynamics**:  
   - Small caps (e.g., IDFC First Bank, Indigo Paints) can grow faster and justify higher P/E ratios due to scalability.  
   - Large caps (e.g., HDFC Bank) may stagnate after rapid growth, requiring patience for time corrections.  
6. **Exit Strategies**: Always plan exitsâ€”either through *capital rotation* (shifting to better opportunities) or *stop-loss* (though the author prefers the former due to tracking constraints).  
7. **Market Manipulation**: Acknowledges that stock markets can be manipulated, making "buy-and-forget" strategies risky.  
8. **Context Matters**: Investment rules (e.g., P/E focus) apply less to small caps due to their growth potential.  

Note: The text includes informal analogies (e.g., chasing a bus, a child's height growth) to simplify concepts.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
margin of safety everyone understand why this is 0% margin of safety because I'm not buying any significant time correction I'm buying an uptrend okay and there is no time correction no time correction has happened in this zone right from here to here no price correction has happened in this zone okay and I'm buying at 0% margin of safety and loading up here okay then what do you think would have happened here the P would have been very high okay so P like for example 45 P you are then the P started to correct and stabilize over time now this high P took how much time to correct it took years to correct okay so it took like seven years to correct okay and now maybe another rally will start okay so this is how typically stocks behave and you can judge it from that P ratio also okay so for example here the stock P in 2019 peak and you are buying was 42 okay very similar to cams cup he's you which I'll write as 45 now the stock is available at 11 P and no one is buying it okay so the point I'm trying to tell you is that access bank was it a growth asset in 2019 yes if you look back at its balance sheet solid asset blue chip company great corporate great management great this great that everything great great great right that revenues increasing yes profits increasing yes price increasing of the stock absolutely yes should you chase the bus no okay so I think what was that film star who gave the dialogue with three things who give each of them you should have only one thing right so like like the bus and train or something like this so I don't know who was that right so there was some movie where there there was a famous dialogue right so and it's true right that if you chase a running bus right you're not it's not going to be useful okay so at any point in time as long as you're not buying so Joe modified bar strategy for us is very simple that you buy some margin of safety if you're buying time direction if you're buying price correction you will not go wrong as long as you're investing for three to five years okay so without creating any implications for you guys because you might guys might be working like day and day out on the stock on sorry in the in your job and you don't have time to track and you will say that boss just tell me like simplest way of creating portfolio I'll explain okay so let me first explain like time correction also and then I'll explain price sorry price correction so in my time correction I'll show okay so for example right the price correction here is what like so just a GDF see if it clear the thing in fact now I'm going to be there right so I'll just quickly show you here okay so from here to here right how much what was the price in 2022 960 what is the price now 1000 how many years gone three years ago okay did the firm post better numbers yes revenues better yes profits better yes stock P 11 yes in each is I got I don't think so okay so is it a great asset now Dubai short answer is yes okay and what are you buying on access bank right now you're buying a time correction okay 28% drop here so this is a much safer asset to own so this is called as value investing okay that you are buying some kind of correction beat price correction time correction and in some cases both correction time plus price correction okay on an asset which is growing in value or in an industry which is growing faster than GDP okay everyone is understanding these points okay good so that's that right and okay price correction you can see on a lot of things right for example HDFC okay HDFC now for example again same story right because the entire industry went into a price correction mode okay sorry time correction mode so for example from here to here 21st it was it was trading at 1570 1600 now it is trading at 1700 so four years gone nothing happened on the stock okay but it's it's wrong to say that nothing happened on the stock okay that's what an amateur would say what has happened on the stock is that it has gone like this now what does the meaning of this okay this is slide upward trend okay so people who traded on HDFC made money people who invested on HDFC lost time okay I'll repeat that statement that people who traded on HDFC made money people who invested on HDFC lost time so when you hear arguments like buy and forget and all that stuff it's it doesn't work okay why because just say they're not saying what they're saying then go stock investing but you're not right and what they will say is that here if you're using like some companies product and you like that product then you just invested and you forget it no that's stupidity okay why is that right because stock market is manipulated okay that's the problem right for example in 2019 HDFC was a great man I access was fine there was no problem with access man they were posting good results everything was great there was no like you know kind of like corporate governance issues the way it happened for ICICI bank Chandakochar issue but HDFC had been a clean bank okay but what happened in 2019 if you're sitting okay as an investor you will look at that we know what banks much you grow to read I'll go and put my money in banks okay so what are you doing you're not buying any type of correction okay now you will say that okay fine with you know you are doing like you know past post-mortem analysis talk about today okay okay so for example today where do you see sentiments being extremely bullish gold okay that's one right what are you buying on gold are you buying any time direction no are you buying any price correction no what are you buying your mind extremely positive sentiment okay so bulk investing absolutely do not do right if you want to invest in gold invest but let's say that your budget of investing in gold is one lack don't invest more than 10 thousand right now okay wait to buy some kind of correction because the asset will go sideways okay or the chances of that asset going sideways is very very high okay hope every ununderstances okay now when does this rules or these rules do not apply now these rules do not typically apply for a really small cap mid cap companies right the smaller the size of the company these rules apply less and less okay so let me tell you the story of noama wealth for example okay or rather let's let me pick something like IDFC first bank okay so IDFC first is easier bank to understand so if you go on IDFC first bank and check the market cap right this is the size of the company okay now HDFC is a hundred and 1.2 lakh per hour okay which is almost like you know what like 30 40 times 40 times 1.5 lakh okay HDFC one this is 41,000 growth okay so IDFC first bank is around 30 times less or smaller than HDFC bank okay now if now what does IDFC first growth rate depends on it depends on branch education okay if it is putting more branches it will expand really fast okay that's what it is okay now what is what about like HDFC bank has it already expanded everywhere it possibly can most of the places yes okay but IDFC first bank is in branch expansion growth it is not available everywhere right for example it might not be if you are living in a tier 3 city or a small village it might not be but HDFC bank would be there okay so what happens is that the growth rate for example if you see IDFC first bank growing at a 25% CHGR if you see IDFC first bank growing at a 25% CHR you might feel that okay this bank is not going to grow at 25% CHR but the chances of it growing faster is higher because it's a small cap on we get when it comes to banking okay typical standard definition of your small cap that has to be less than 6000 growth but in banking context if you just apply brain and look at like from a private sector perspective we can consider IDFC first bank to a mid cap company from a private bank perspective okay what about city union bank okay so city union bank is a private bank right city union bank it is available at a P of 10 it is only 11,000 growth okay if it opens like very few branches also it can expand its balance sheet fast right and is it a profitable bank is it able to grow its revenue all that stuff yes it is growing right for example here is it not as if it is not expanding here is it not okay so this growth rate right now is not great but it can become great with time okay so that's what I'm getting at right that in a positive environment this can grow okay so I hope that this point is clear that you cannot treat like Asian paints similar to indigo paints indigo paints is a smaller company it can grow faster so there you can give them a high P break for example if you take a look at indigo paints and if it is not a winner takes all market right so this 33 P might look expensive to you but because of the fact that this is a small cap company you need to not worry too much about this okay do you guys understand that why don't we worry about too much about P of a small cap company okay because of the fact that a small cap can double its size very quickly it's like my son is five right if I have to do his height analysis so he's like whatever like three feet okay by next year he would have added 33% of his height okay but how much height will I add nothing okay because I'm already six six feet okay so that's the difference between HDFC bag and IDFC first one that's the difference between Asian paints and indigo paints so everyone understood this context that same rules do not apply that PE value sees what I was telling you okay so back to bottom up analysis and top down analysis important key takeaway is that you need to buy some kind of correction okay margin of safety sorry so it can either be a price correction or a time correction I hope this is clear to everyone next point you must have a very clear exit strategy in mind okay and there are two exit strategies one is called as capital rotation one is called a stop loss okay now usually I don't apply stop loss because I don't have the time to track things
