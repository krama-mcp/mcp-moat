==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text covers a diverse range of financial and investment topics, including property investment in Dubai and Goa, agricultural land, tax residency strategies, stock market investments in India vs. global markets, and systematic withdrawal plans (SWP). It also touches on personal finance questions, such as tax implications for NRIs, gifting money to family members, and optimizing tax efficiency by relocating to low-tax jurisdictions like the UAE. The speaker provides cautious advice on several topics, emphasizing the need for tailored solutions based on individual circumstances.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Real Estate:** Dubai offers high rental yields but lower property appreciation, while Goa’s villas have lower rental yields (~4-5%) but high appreciation potential.  
- **Agricultural Land:** Cash flows from agricultural land are typically poor, and its suitability depends on specific factors; the speaker avoids a definitive recommendation.  
- **Global Investments:** A 15–25% exposure to emerging markets (e.g., India) is advised for diversification, even for those investing in US/China markets.  
- **Tax Efficiency:** Moving to low-tax jurisdictions (e.g., UAE) can significantly reduce tax burdens, especially for high-income earners or large capital investments.  
- **NRI Tax Challenges:** UK/India tax residents face high taxes; offshore accounts (e.g., UAE) can offer access to broader investment options (e.g., cryptocurrencies).  
- **Gifting to Relatives:** In India, gifting money to family members (e.g., children) is tax-free and can be a strategy to manage tax liabilities.  
- **SWP Video Request:** A viewer requests a dedicated video on Systematic Withdrawal Plans (SWP) and NPS (National Pension System) tax benefits.  
- **Avoiding Scams:** The speaker dismisses astrology/tarot as unreliable for investment decisions and cautions against mixing them with financial planning.  
- **US Citizenship Pitfalls:** US citizens face worldwide taxation; becoming a UAE tax resident is suggested for better tax efficiency.  
- **Offshore Accounts:** Useful for accessing restricted investments (e.g., crypto) but may not benefit those already in high-tax countries like the UK.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
on in Dubai if you buy flats then the rental yield is exceptional but the underlying property appreciation is not that high it's the opposite situation in Goa right that if you buy a villa the rental yield if you can find 4-5 percent it's great because the underlying growth rate of Goa villa is a very high right so they have to mix and match and see but I like to stop for me to like you know sort of give like a general commentary here yes for capital protection our underlying asset appreciation for this thing we can retain right I don't know maybe it's it's it's okay okay and then what what if you are what if not it will generate cash flows the property is not generating the cash flows you said about agricultural land buying agricultural land is there any advantages of owning agricultural land you know that's an entirely different conversation that you're starting which I'll not be able to wrap up in like a Q&A format right so that requires like a different you know layer of thinking right so which so therefore I'm not I don't want to like you know comment on something which will put you in trouble right so just being conservative right so I would not say anything that's the guidance only not it probably I cannot say anything I cannot say that by agricultural land you might be buying it with the intent of generating cash flow now cash flows are really bad on agricultural land so agricultural land generally does it make sense maybe right it depends on a lot of factors since I've not taught that on this you know sort of setups I can't really comment yeah okay thank you so much and one more thing this one kind request from me that we want a video from you in the SWP systematic withdrawal plan how it is doing some end up tricks we have confirmed that SAP is kind of a scam you said so let's wrap it up for SWP itself okay we want a special request video on this and also for the NPS to cut down the taxes in the future NTCG okay NPS know like when I am not we want from you the video thank you thank you so much thank you right so much yes hi sir first of I want to thank you for such a eye opener and life changing course thank you I am in share market since last one and a half year okay and 80% and lost 50% 50% even in half years okay previously I was doing trying to get 50% on my 20% for for you okay and the one take care from of course is it is more better to take 20% again from 50% for you it is more safe yeah absolutely so that's by in that way I will change my investment thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you very much thank you first of all thank you akshed for such a lovely you know course over these four weeks and I was always against stocks I used to stock my husband as well but now I myself because I'm convinced that I should go ahead and do it so all thanks to you now my first question is because we are I mean I'm living in Singapore so can I completely overlook Indian stock market and instead just invest in a US and China market because do I understand the Indian sentiment but despite that no so basically like India serves a purpose even for enterprise right it's an emerging market play so you should always have like 20 25% of your capital in an emerging market unless you're getting some kind of structural tax advantage then also I have like at least 10 15% of your equity in emerging market so cut the long story short you at least need to have 15% India exposure okay now my second question is as you said that we can have we can do blogging as well for the you know recurring income tiny bit of cash for something so my only thing is because I am into tarot and astrology which you've been continuously mentioning so is it a good idea to mix two things only when I reach a level where I understand stocks myself no I don't know like anything about that tarot and astrology it's a scam to me so like I don't want to offend you or anything right but I don't know that's okay that's absolutely fine and my last question is because there's an NRA WhatsApp group right so is it a same book that you've joined for this course so there's a different group so I talk about like US talk investing separately right so there are regular classes right so every month we meet and discuss my portfolio whatever updates I give very clear buying cell calls so that's NRI community right so that's there on my what that's there on my website if you go and check you will get access to it and also post written in do I search what's called as NRI communities is just such search NRI community wisdom much and you will be able to access it okay okay thank you so much Aksha thank you once again thank you all thank you all thank you for everything my question is a bit personal related and my son is going to become a US citizen in another six eight months time okay so should I open a phone with him to buy US stocks or okay then he didn't his account only or I become a tax resident of Dubai or some other place and do that so US has a high tax account will be upwards of two CRs yeah no so best option is that you become a tax resident of UA if you want to trade like a capital of two three CR it's a lot of capital reason is that US is a high tax economy so your son will also have to pay very high tax you will also have to pay very high tax because you're an indent tax resident so there is no tax saving by going to or becoming a US tax resident or so US taxed isn't US citizenship even worse because US tax has a worldwide taxation even if your son comes to Dubai and becomes a tries to become a UA tax resident he can't yes that's the issue so you should become like a tax resident of Dubai okay I'll try to come down and meet you in the way when let's see please come right and I think that's going to be a really interesting event right so if you can make it definitely do it okay yeah actually I actually I live in UK and 60 or 70 80 percent of my investment is in India because I started some time ago that's okay but my problem is my taxes are affected at source there because I am registered as an NRI even if I buy something from UK through IBCR or anything I also have to file tax because I'm under on the high tax from mark slab so if I if I invest through West Tech it is a matter of so you will still have to pay UK taxes because you're UK tax resident right so who's trading an Indian account even if you invest see tax residency means primarily right for simple simpler understanding that you are a resident of a particular country or tax resident of a particular country right now you are a tax resident of a UK or UK economy now UK is a high tax country India is a high tax country there is no tax arbitrage this US is a high tax country right so these are all high tax countries where do you get benefit if you move to like UA you get a lot of benefit if you want to share taxation is generally lower if you move to let's just sing up or then again capital unions is zero so these are efficient tax economies so the point if your goal is to reduce taxation number one you have to move to a low tax economy okay last question quickly if I have an HSBC account which get global HSBC account which I operate from UA I can start an account in UA as well will I be able to start and you will still not get tax benefits right the entire goal of offshore account is to get access to more investment instruments for example if an Indian tax resident it's very difficult for you to buy cryptocurrencies okay or BTC because there is no option to buy cryptocurrencies legitimately in India what do you do you need a offshore bank account so that you know sort of buy so then HSBC account kind of makes sense right in your case UK residents can buy cryptocurrency easily there is no problem yeah so yeah there is no benefit for you on that right and yeah unfortunately 50 55% taxpayer on top I'm a 55% taxpayer only get 45 65% you pay tax 55 55 I'm a consultant or it's no consultant so if I earn 100 pounds I will get 45 in my hands and you're doing freelancing or what exactly I'm freelancing why you don't need a UK contract work contracting I'm not as a freelancing but we can do contract work for hospitals okay but why are you in UK I don't I don't get it right for example if you can register if you have global lines then you can let's stay a company in UAE and pay like 9% corporate tax so that's what I do my patients are all in UK so I can't and my my employer will be UK hospitals I have no way of getting it out okay okay thank you nothing nothing yeah on that thank you let's say let's say yes yeah thanks for it was a wonderful session thank you very much I like your idea when you said that you should if it's not possible for me to change our tax presidency at least you can invest from my daughters needs my I have a 23 year old daughter who's earning the same but if I transfer if I want to invest such large amount transferring money to her name will be an issue right then we are tax implications that will consider as her income was it okay will I be able to transfer the money to her name yeah you can so it's called an India you can gift to your relatives right so that's not a problem at all so literally you can give your money to from your HDFC account to your daughter yours is already tax money there is no tax that will be sort of exploited from her more right so blood blood relatives like the the earth that's comes under gifting right so you can gift it to your daughter not a problem but there is no limit on that gift I don't think so CS can confirm but according to me there is no limit okay another thing to say that 250k USD is it for your limit or one time per year limit per member pan card right so for example if you have if your daughter is in let's say she already has an account in UA so she can transfer 250k from her account in India and then you can transfer from 250k from your account in India to UA okay so and last question about the great points you talked
