SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses investment strategies, emphasizing the importance of focusing on high-growth sectors like technology (e.g., AI) in the US, which outperforms the broader economy (e.g., tech indices like Nasdaq rising 881% vs. S&P 500's 329% since 2012). They also highlight growth industries in India (e.g., banking, healthcare) and caution against low-growth sectors like manufacturing. Key advice includes analyzing valuation metrics (P/E ratios), assessing disruption risks, and prioritizing "sticky" businesses (e.g., regulated sectors like banking). The session concludes with a teaser for fundamental and market analysis deeper dives.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Tech sector dominance:** US tech (e.g., AI) grows significantly faster (20% annually) than the broader economy (~4%), making it a prime investment area.  
- **Sectoral growth in India:** Banking and healthcare are high-growth, "sticky" industries, while manufacturing lags. Uncertain sectors (e.g., data centers) require deeper due diligence.  
- **Valuation metrics matter:** Focus on P/E ratios (absolute, relative, trailing, forward) to gauge company/industry valuation.  
- **Disruption risk:** Prioritize sectors with low disruption potential (e.g., regulated banking in India) for stability.  
- **Cost-efficient investing:** Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs) in curated stock portfolios can minimize commissions.  
- **Regulation as protection:** Highly regulated industries (e.g., Indian banking) are resilient to disruption (e.g., crypto challenges).  
- **Upcoming analysis:** Future sessions will explore stock price drivers and fundamental/market analysis techniques.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 now let's change the question let's change the question to US economy now what is a good sector definitely to invest take okay why take okay because the growth rate of take is almost 10x or not 10x maybe at least x67x that of the US economies that's a fact okay so for example AI is growing at what 20% a year US economy grows at maybe 4% a year right which 5x stronger than the US economy right so therefore it kind of makes sense to be a general investor in tech slash okay another way like I mean I'll just tell you I'll actually show you the data also so for example go here right on trading view okay just trading you let's want there okay okay so here what do you do is that you go here right and you compare like US broad market with US tech market so for example if you look at excel gate right so this is a tech index right so this is index okay and you compare it with S&P 500 right so this is spx which is S&P 500 since 2012 S&P 500 has gone up by 329% and excel gate which is a tech index similar to Nasdaq it has gone up by 881% why because excel gate is a tech focused index spx is the broad market broad market means this includes more tech this includes like you know manufacturing this includes agriculture this is broad 500 stocks in the US okay so generally right as a general rule where should you be investing your money in the US in tech because that is where major growth is coming from in the US okay so everyone understands that you know at a sectoral level why it's super easy to like you know sort of eliminate things for example what is another growth industry in India healthcare right so that is huge right healthcare is a sticky business it's if you check the recent performance of healthcare so if you're doing SIP on healthcare or SIP on banks is it okay to do it yes okay why because these are generally going faster than the economy okay so it's okay to do that right you create like a block of like 10 15 stocks that you trust and do SIP in that you how much commissions will you be paying answer is 0 okay so you don't have to pay any commission on that SIP right 15 so here money saved right horse for your school so all the all that's all you need to do right so you can easily do that okay that's not an issue okay which other industry do you think is okay so if I have just have to tell you like very quickly wrap up this conversation right and then we'll take a quick break there are three types of industries that are out there okay number one right you have growth right for example in India if you're talking about right it would be banks which will grow faster than the economy healthcare okay which will grow what are low growth which will definitely not grow faster than the economy manufacturing agree okay this will not happen okay then there are uncertain industries what are uncertain industries for example data center IT okay will it grow will it not grow I don't know okay so if you have confidence go and invest if you don't have confidence don't invest I don't know like I'm in with a data center will grow at what pace it will grow and all that stuff because technically the way I understand is the data center you require larger space again real estate is very expensive in India the new companies that are coming up at what valuation are they coming up there are 100 different like you know criteria that you need to understand so there is no certainty around it for example if a Daringi decided to be a humidious interview will I right so then guy right I mean whatever businesses you are investing in right now on data center okay so basically like you have to understand like are there any broad red flags on an industry okay that's how I will look at it okay but I but I hope that you got the understanding that okay what is the meaning of a business when you want to stop what is the meaning you should not look at price you should look at price to earning and if you're analyzing price to earning to figure out the valuation of the company the most easiest way of doing it is very simple that look at four factors absolute P relative P PRP and forward P right and try to guess what that is that industry is going to grow or not and finally is the disruption point okay that what is the probability of that business getting disrupted okay for example what is the probability of banking industry getting disrupted in India and by whom okay so for example do you think that a Dhani Ji can own a bank very quickly in India will be good for like generally no it's not that easy okay because then banks will give loans to his own company which is like it's just tough to do right and therefore a money is to not own a bank right technically on top of that you might think that okay cryptocurrency is very destroyed like banks in India why you are so Bhajdhiyo in the crypto all over right so I mean no that and even if that happens it will be done through primary banks to appoint a MD CEO of a private bank like HDFC or Kotech Mindra bank where does that private bank need to take permission or whom does it need to take permission from RBI okay so a private business has to take permission from RBI to change the board member okay from RBI right so private banks are technically an extended arm of the government okay it is as regulated as it gets and therefore disrupting it is close to impossible for example if I want to start a bank in India I can't do it okay at this stage okay so it's close to impossible for me to start a bank okay but if I have to start a YouTube channel or if I have to start like a crypto based startup etc that I can do okay so the point is that these things so wherever you find stickiness that okay this business is not going to get disrupted that's possibly an okay business and it will have a more stable P okay so for example it will not happen you know see the beast it does so jaihos for P right crypto forces in the making no I'm not doing like I don't teach that much guys I mean I maybe like do like six sevens a year right so like including my classes okay so I keep like my life time free okay so yeah so to cut the long story short this is how you need to think now we will just I give you a flavor of fundamental understanding is now in the next session I'll give you a flavor of what market analysis right so you'll study the data from a market point of view right and then we will deep dive into fundamental class so this class is divided into two so in the evening we will do like a fundamental analysis class more but here we will pause fundamental analysis because I just wanted to give you a flavor of what business means okay and now I will help you understand why a business goes up in price and down in price okay and why does the stock goes up in price down in price and who are the major movers of this entire game okay okay so let's take like a five minute break and let's be back at 1246 okay
