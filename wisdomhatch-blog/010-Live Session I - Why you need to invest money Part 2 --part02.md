SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses investment strategies focusing on identifying arbitrage opportunities, particularly in real estate, using a cultural example from Bangkok where Indians buy undervalued second-hand properties that locals avoid due to superstitions. It emphasizes the importance of asset quality, valuation, and understanding macroeconomic liquidity. The speaker critiques poor investment choices like certain Indian FDs and PMS schemes, advocating for disciplined investing in undervalued, high-quality assets. Key concepts include liquidity-driven asset appreciation, quantitative easing, and the role of interest rates in economic cycles.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Cultural Arbitrage in Real Estate:** Exploiting cultural differences (e.g., Thai ghost superstitions vs. Indian demand for large homes) can create profitable real estate opportunities by buying undervalued properties and renovating them.  
- **Asset Quality Over Hype:** Investing should prioritize fundamentally sound assets (e.g., private bank ETFs, prime real estate) over speculative bets (e.g., low-quality stocks like Yes Bank or Gen Sol Engineering).  
- **Liquidity & Macro Trends:** Increased money flow (liquidity) into economies drives asset price appreciation, but not uniformly. Central bank policies (e.g., quantitative easing) and low interest rates fuel borrowing and investment bubbles.  
- **Avoid Poor Investment Products:** Indian FDs and high-commission PMS schemes often erode returns. Opt for structured, low-cost investments in robust asset classes.  
- **Patience & Position Building:** Good assets may face short-term volatility but recover over time. Investors should build positions incrementally at support levels (e.g., discounted private bank ETFs).  
- **Skepticism Toward Speculation:** Internal company workings are often opaque; avoid stocks with questionable governance. Focus on tangible assets (e.g., Bangalore land) with long-term value.  
- **Macroeconomic Awareness:** Understanding interest rates and liquidity cycles is critical for timing investments (e.g., borrowing cheaply during low-rate environments like the US in 2020).  

**Notable Examples:**  
- Bangkok real estate arbitrage: Buying half a building cheaply, renovating, and selling to Indian buyers.  
- Private bank ETFs as a high-quality, undervalued asset class in India.  
- Criticism of Yes Bank and Gen Sol Engineering for transparency risks.  
- UAE FDs as preferable to Indian FDs due to better inflation protection.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
een if you find good deals in real estate if you find good deals in tax optimization so that's a game that I play now right so tax optimization hedging. So for example in my and you look for arbitrages that's the idea okay. For example right through my hedge fund we recently like I'm in around like 12 months back we bought like a roughly 12 month back we started looking at a deal in Bangkok okay so you bought like half a building in Bangkok I'll say that okay have you gone mad why you mind like half a building arbitrage and it's a cultural arbitrage so it's a very interesting conversation so basically like I'm in Bangkok cotton Thailand. Thai people do not buy second hand homes why because they are scared of ghosts and they feel that you know someone has died in the house and if you live in it then that ghost is going to enter your body or whatever right so Thai people do not buy that okay so like second hand homes with thin yeah okay so that's a problem right that's a cultural arbitrage do Indians give a crap about that no Indians want to buy bigger homes okay so almost like 40 45% of bias or like new bias are Indians no that's data for the way. In Bangkok it's around 25% bias are Indians and one primary feature of Indians buying real estate in Bangkok is that they buy bigger homes so as Indians we love bigger homes okay because we need like close kitchen and all that. Now that's an arbitrage and any old property that you buy in Bangkok you're going to get it cheap so basically like now if you're buying one single apartment you can not renovate the building okay but if you're buying half a building then you can renovate and it pretty much becomes new so you're buying cheap selling and. So you're buying the existing PSF and you make arbitrage right so there's a very specific method of doing it right so I hope I was able to explain you the point that investing is about. Exploring opportunities it's not about like you know sort of J.R. you know IDFC you know what's the name innocent bank fill so we'll buy it unnecessarily is the asset quality good if that is not there then you don't touch it okay but in real estate all that stuff the asset quality is good so what I'm trying to tell you through this chart the Excel spreadsheet that I just told you. Right that discussed with you here for example this private bank index here what is the meaning of index index is collection of private banks it includes like protect bank HDFC bank ICICF bank access bank now see was I mean innocent bank might be a bad private bank we cannot comment on the asset quality but when it comes to private bank ETF or private bank index is the asset quality bad of private banks. It can have temporary issues very similar to saying NASDAQ as an asset quality wise it is bad no it is not right it's tech index tech is going to add value over time it might happen that over the next month it might correct by like I don't know 15% because volatility is high but it's not as if that the value of it you know will not come back up okay because what ends up happening is that if you buy bad quality assets what is an example of a bad quality asset. Stock market let's go. In this and I don't know whether the asset quality is good or bad yes bank I don't know if it is good or bad. Gen Sol engineering a lot of talk is happening on Gen Sol engineering that the founder came on the new channel he said I'm not going to sell stocks next day you know floods the stock market by selling his own equity. So we don't know right I mean we don't know 80 90% of the internal workings of a company so we need to appreciate that and acknowledge that but when it comes to certain things for example well protected land in Bangalore is it a good asset or a bad asset. My voice is good guys everyone is able to hear me so it's a good quality asset it might happen that temporarily maybe like next year or the market has stagnated homes are not selling in Bangalore so maybe you will not be able to liquidate it but maybe in the next month it's not going to be a good quality asset. So we can't wait for it to be updated but maybe in five six years when the cycle improves you will be able to liquidate it at very high prices. So understanding this basic of asset quality is very important and whenever you get good quality assets at somewhat reasonable price you buy and you said tight that is what investing has become right it is not a sipping I can like and I probably like you know few years time people will write a book on this topic why a sipping will not work. So we assume that stock market will forever go up but what if there is there are structural issues with the stock market then and if you're not studying it you're just like a blind person just unnecessarily throwing money after money it's not going to help you out right so yeah so that's a bottom line right. So yeah that's that's what I would say in terms of this right for example private bank ETF is not a bad quality asset collection of top private banks in India. This is trading at roughly 15 16% discount right now can it happen that for example it falls by another 5 10% it falls still here yes of course this is a support right you buy more right that is called as position building so how to build position this I also I will teach you with time but for the time being just understand that it is already trading at a very good support level right and it's not a bad quality asset so you are definitely not overpaying and add the same time this is a good quality asset. So this is a net addition asset on your portfolio when will it come up what the market view will be like in like you know six months from I don't know about all this these are all speculations okay the only thing even the top investors can do check the asset quality is it good band the very clear answer check whether or not it is somewhat under value these are the two questions that we explore as an investor I hope this point is here okay now coming to the core topics right so all right. So I hope this point is clear what is asset class and diversification right goals of different asset classes I hope everyone understood you understood that what are structurally bad asset classes to invest in according to me PF EPS PPS are structurally bad asset classes Indian FDs are typically bad asset classes if you have an option of investing in FDs in developed countries it kind of makes more sense because these are more they protect your way. So for example I gave you the example of UAE FDs right why it protects us I showed you the math also what is a bad investment product where you're paying very high commission for example many of you have the habit of using PMS is if the PMS if the nifty generating 12.5% and if your PMS is consistently generating 2223% then it kind of makes sense to pay 2% AUM okay it's not 2% from profits are they are charging they are charging 2% AUM which is good. It's crazy okay it's like you're making 12 and because you're paying 2% your net profit falls to 10 right so that's how it's like just crazy okay so be very clear about all these things okay next point. Now this is where we start like some macro concepts and the most important concept that I would like to teach is the concept of liquidity okay now don't get bogged down with the fancy words that I'm using because bankers typically use this I cannot change it but liquidity simply means more money flow in the economy for example imagine this to be India if more money is flowing for example let's say that this is 2024 and the total money flowing in the Indian economy is 5 trillion dollars okay and buy it 2025 if the total money flowing in India becomes 10 trillion dollars what is the number one thing that will happen or what is the number one change which will happen it will lead to something called as asset price appreciation apa okay now what is the meaning of asset price appreciation for example if we suddenly increase the total flow of money into the economy rich people will get access to it okay so for it and how do it everything will go up yes but not everything will go up equally okay so that is where the understanding of economics comes into the equation okay so usual way right the way this happens as that for example and let me draw this for you so the way money is released or as or liquidity is increased into the economy is very simple right so RBI is there and you have commercial banks like commercial banks like access bank all that stuff right you have government okay and you have customers now the government will tell RBI that boss we are facing a 2020 cow COVID like crisis all the factories are shut economy is not moving okay so RBI will say that okay let's do something called as quantitative easter now quantitative easing means that we will increase the liquidity in the system so instead of having five trillion dollars in the economy we will put like 10 trillion dollars and add five trillion dollars into the mix okay so what will happen here five trillion dollars are sent to these commercial banks and what will they do they will loan at what rate close to 0% right in the US okay so for example in 2020 right and this you can check by certain for something called as interest rates okay so interest rate means the borrowing rate okay so for example if you simply go interest rates in the US your vice yeah so you check right what you will see is this so here here you will see 20 20 interested fell to 0.25% okay now what is the meaning of 0.25 and what is the difference between 2.5 at 0.25 what happens versus 2.5 okay so if I have to become let's say next Adhani what do I need I need loans okay I don't need a business I don't need anything I just need banks to lend me like an order five trillion dollars okay banks can lend me five trillion dollars I can buy as it I can buy ports I can buy a lot of things and call it my yeah so that therefore there's excessive ob nobbing between like politicians an
