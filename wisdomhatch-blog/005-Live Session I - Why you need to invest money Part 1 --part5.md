SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker discusses the importance of seizing investment opportunities, particularly in real estate and stock markets, by being prepared with knowledge and capital. They share personal examples, such as buying a house in Goa at a distressed price due to urgent seller needs, and emphasize that such opportunities arise globally (e.g., Dubai, Bangalore). The speaker contrasts real estate's opaque pricing with stocks' transparency, where daily price fluctuations are visible. They stress the need to understand diverse asset classes (real estate, stocks, gold, etc.) and their unique purposes (growth, liquidity, cash flow). A key insight is that true opportunities are only actionable if you already understand the asset classâ€”delayed learning leads to missed deals. The speaker also introduces an Excel framework to categorize assets by their functional roles (e.g., growth vs. stability) and hints at underlying economic principles (e.g., factors of production) driving asset values.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Act on Opportunities**: Successful investing requires capital and readiness to buy undervalued assets during distress (e.g., urgent real estate sales).  
- **Asset Class Mastery**: Opportunities are only accessible if you already know the asset (e.g., real estate in specific cities or stock market segments). Delayed learning means missed deals.  
- **Transparency Difference**: Real estate lacks price visibility (owners often unaware of current values), while stocks are highly visible, causing emotional reactions to volatility.  
- **Diversify Knowledge**: Understanding multiple asset classes (global stocks, real estate, gold) expands your ability to spot and act on opportunities.  
- **Asset Purpose Framework**: Each asset serves distinct goals (growth, liquidity, cash flow, etc.). For example, real estate offers growth and cash flow but lacks liquidity.  
- **Economic Fundamentals**: Land (real estate) grows in value long-term as a factor of production, tracking inflation due to its underlying economic role.  
- **Risk-Reward Ladder**: Progress from safer assets (FDs, large caps) to riskier ones (small caps, derivatives) as knowledge deepens, but avoid complexity prematurely (e.g., F&O).  
- **Black Money in Real Estate**: Official data may understate real estate growth due to unaccounted transactions, requiring local market insight.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
les of the game for you the point being that as an investor you have to buy opportunities that's it okay so this happens in real estate very easy to understand that there might in your society someone might be doing a distressed sale should you buy it yes for example this house where I'm currently in so I bought it in Goa this is my house right I mean this is the first house I have bought ever in my life that I'm going to live not going to rent not going to year be nothing and I'm going to be a buraza lagara because I'm getting the entire innovation done so so the point being that I bought this right and here like I'm special situations come okay so for example in this society no one sells because half of the society people are like you know and arise they don't even live they don't even do Airbnb how the society is ghost town and they don't want to do anything with their property and they don't even sell why because they all are like those are the rules right so they don't need to sell like anything okay so here the deal was that hey I want like this money entire money invite by tomorrow okay so like if you have capital you get to buy cheap okay so that's a simple point okay now something similar is going to happen in Dubai okay so I'm telling you already right so something similar is going to happen in Bangalore okay so all these things are going to happen right it's just that you have to take advantage of these opportunities has an investor now these opportunities also come in the stock market but in stock market this is more difficult to digest what do why do I say it because it's like this right having for example you own a house and then then you know someone like and this is an example that was given by Warren Buffett and Elon Musk that if someone stands in front of your house right every day eight in the morning and start yelling your house price then you'll get to know and you will start thinking about yeah you're the needs to like it basically not you're right and all that stuff you'll be stressed about it but do you even know what your house is worth today half of you would not even have a clue okay in my society for example people do not have a clue what the house is worth they are living in like Australia or wherever Japan and all that stuff and they are clueless what the house price here actually is okay it's very hard to figure out housing prices in India right so everyone with me right that okay like you know you need to understand as an investor our key objective is very simple that we take advantage of opportunities and to now comes a very natural question that how do you take advantage of opportunities you can only take advantage of your opportunities if you have a range of assets that you can potentially buy for example if you know about real estate and if there is a distressed deal and you can analyze that deal you can buy it okay but if you know nothing about Bangkok real estate even if a distress sale is going in Bangkok real estate hypothetically some sections will you be able to buy it you'll say you know I'll start learning about Bangkok real estate when the distress happens but by that time you learn and you execute it's already done okay so those deals are gone what about Dubai real estate same thing what about goa real estate same thing what about Bombay real estate same thing what about Bangalore real estate same things what about like large caps now here it's easier to do okay so for example because everyone each of us can track nifty 50 it's given to us right every day you'll read a headline right in the newspaper oh you know 10,000 crore of wealth of investors got wiped out from the market you'll say oh brother you're right so because there is someone sitting on your head and yelling the prices of stocks each day okay so so that's the point the more arrows you have in your arsenal that you know about different different types of real estate stock market different types U.S. stock market Indian stock market European stock market you know about FNO etc I was against FNO okay but over time I have warmed up to the idea that see the more you know the better it is I'm not trying to get you guys into FNO okay please don't do it you don't need to start there okay but the point is that you'll go through this journey and this is called as laddering that first you understand like you know you start with every investment then mutual funds then large caps then small caps mid caps hedging all that so you'll go through this journey and the more ahead you are in this journey the better you will be able to see opportunities that's a very logical thing that I'm telling you now this does not mean that you remain dumb as a beginner or an intermediate guy okay and if you understand this risk reward curve you will not be dumb yeah for example here is FD right here is S&P 500 here is Nifty 50 here is large cap small caps sorry small cap mid caps then you have thrifted you have gold on this curve now see this is like very easy for us to understand this is what finance professors also tell you okay but what they don't tell you is that every asset class every asset type and serves a very different purpose okay so this is an Excel spreadsheet that I will create with you right and if you understand this this is your fifth key takeaway right and if you understand this Excel spreadsheet it will add a lot of value to your life okay so let me just put it up okay so and I'll share this Excel spreadsheet with with all of you right so okay so for example this is now every asset class serves a different purpose and according to me every asset class has to serve at least one of these six purposes okay now or there will be more right I mean you can fill more blanks right I mean how it goes right so let me just help you understand for example if you if you invest in let's say real states so real states start now can real estate grow yes okay now you'll say that no RBI data does not tell us by Zav Iqbal Zathor right I mean would RBI include black money into real estate no right now if RBI selling saying to 23% growth that does not mean that to give a state has only grown at 23% someone in India it's very common real estate deals in black money and all that so it can't be accounted but from your own investigation you will whichever city you live in whichever location you live in you will clearly understand that she was real estate grows it's not as if that it does not grow do people lose money in real estate yes do people lose money in stocks yes but if you're buying high quality real estate high quality stocks then the chances of losses very less right so that's we can agree now what is the meaning of growth when I write growth expectation here it means that it can at least grow faster than inflation so does real estate grow faster than inflation good quality real estate yes why there is a structure behind it okay so if you go back and study economics now there is something called as factors of production now factors of production means that for example land labor capital and enterprise right either at a land okay these are factors of production now how is GDP created GDP is the sum total of all the goods and services that is produced within the economy right now how do you produce goods or services you require one of these four things you either require land you require capital labor or enterprise enterprise means that someone has to like you know create an enterprise and you know beyond the prognorial all that stuff land is called as a factor of production now this is the concept of underlying versus derivative okay so for example if there is a mango okay so let me tell you this right so for example mango fruity right now mango fruity prize in 2020 five is let's say 10 rupees okay by 2026 it goes to 15 rupees now this is a derivative product right because mango fruity is made from mango okay or like one could argue let's assume that it's made purely from mango yeah so it's made of sugar but let's assume mango okay now can you imagine that okay that derivative prize is going up by 50 percent but the mango prizes are not going up by 50 percent it won't happen okay similarly for example very simple point right that for example if you have to crude right so crude oil for example if crude becomes expensive now India's import will will also go up because the underlying is crude and India imports very high amount of crude okay so that's the concept of underlying and derivative now something similar happens here that you know it's nonsense to think that real estate will not grow right land will always grow in value okay at least it will match inflation because all this reflects all these four things right if for example why do you think labor in Europe is very high or very is very costly because the per capita GDP of of Europe is high right so in order to like pay them minimum wage the labor is expensive right so that's the bottom line right there scarcity multiple other things are there but this is a concept of underlying and derivative so again like I mean without going into like you know complicated things here I just wanted to quickly help you understand this right so if you look at real estate would it grow the short answer is yes it will grow yeah so what about liquidity liquidity means that can you sell it off very quickly so the short answer is no what about volatility volatility means that for example ss is not right so for example one day the price is 100 rupees then x is like 50 rupees then after that it's 150 rupees so here this is a no okay what about cash flow can you make regular income from real estate yes with a very high degree of uns very high degree of certainty for example even if you have a flat come together but you will get regular cash flow now how is this how does this feature in because I get a lot of questions from people who are hitting that retirement age of people ask me that he actually my
