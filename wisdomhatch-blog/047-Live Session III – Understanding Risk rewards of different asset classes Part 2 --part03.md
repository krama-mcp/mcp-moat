==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses the relationship between government taxation policies and market behavior, particularly focusing on stock markets and cryptocurrencies. It argues that governments prioritize tax revenues, which explains their tolerance for certain asset classes (like stocks) due to high transaction volumes and tax collection. Conversely, cryptocurrencies face restrictions because their decentralized nature makes tax tracking difficult. The author also critiques India's closed mindset compared to the U.S., which allows crypto ETFs to ensure tax compliance. The analysis extends to real estate, highlighting how recent policy changes (removing indexation benefits) aim to boost transaction volumes and tax revenues. Ultimately, the author advises investing in Indian stocks for short-term gains, citing low probability of a secular decline and high government incentive to sustain the market.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Government Prioritizes Taxes:** Governments support asset classes (e.g., stocks) that generate high tax revenues through frequent transactions.  
- **Crypto Restrictions:** Cryptocurrencies are curbed in India due to the lack of a clear taxation framework, not moral or security concerns.  
- **U.S. vs. India Crypto Policies:** The U.S. allows crypto ETFs to capitalize on tax revenues, while India bans them, risking underground markets.  
- **Real Estate Policy Shift:** Removing indexation benefits aims to increase transaction frequency and tax collections in real estate.  
- **Stock Market Viability:** High transaction volumes make stocks a preferred vehicle for government tax revenue, ensuring their survival.  
- **Investment Advice:** Short-term (3–5 years) stock investments in India are favorable due to low risk of secular decline and government incentives.  
- **Volatility Management:** Understanding market mechanics (e.g., institutional counter-buyers) helps navigate volatility.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
uidity. OK. Everyone understands this complicated game. I have tried to simplify it. You will not find it in books unless you yourself like, you know, sort of go through this entire investing thing. Now, who loses? For example, if the stock market from a secular has a secular decline. Right. Secular decline, the meaning. Something like this. So for example, if you go and if you search. OK. So. So no. So this is an IKK index. I don't know. I don't know. I don't trade in like Japan market. So I'll just search. OK. So secular decline means something like this. OK. Right. So for example, this is a secular decline. OK. Now, if this situation happens, what happens to like governments money, will it make more money from the stock market or less money? Less money. What about DIs? They'll make less money because people will stop doing a site. These so DIs also make less money. FIs again will not invest because market is not giving returns. Why would they come to Indian market? They'll go to the next one market, whatever market. Detail also stops. So this entire cash flow or collection of taxes through stock market goes down. OK. Everyone understands, OK, which brings us to our next unrelated yet related question. Why do you think cryptos are de facto band in India? I don't know how many people know this answer. No government control. My government does not give a shit. OK. So as long as government makes its own taxes, they don't care. OK. They will let you trade in dream 11 and ruin your house and family life. OK. And let Rohe Sharma, where art fully advertise the hill out of it. OK. So they don't care about you. OK. So they will sell alcohol if they have to. They're as long as they are getting taxes. The problem is that they don't allow you to buy cryptos because they don't know how to manage taxes on it. How exactly? OK. So for example, if you go to the palika market, right in Delhi, and if you just do a P2P transaction on cryptos, essentially what you have to do is that you have to do a UPI payment to let's say, Yogesh, OK, because I cannot use my example. If someone from ED is watching it, they'll come after Yogesh. OK. Just kidding. OK. So basically, you will transfer like $10,000. So Bharati tells like, you know, send like $10,000 to peace to Yogesh, right? And Yogesh transfers him a bit coin, a fraction of a bit coin. And income tax notice comes to Bharati. Says he, OK, why did you like, you know, pay Yogesh $10,000 to peace? So he gave me consultation. OK. But there is a transfer of asset between Yogesh and Bharati into his hardware wallet. OK. And there is no way the government can track it. Right. It's there for crypto is a bit coin is a private money. OK. And because it's private money and if it adoption picks up, government makes zero tax on it technically. OK. And this is a problem. OK. It's has got nothing to do with more of this terrorist currency. So right. So all that is nonsense. OK. If they were so like, you know, morally pious, right? They would have banned dream 11 to begin with. Like it, but since this is not banned. So like, just leave that debate. OK. Can be used for illegal activities. OK. So great. So cryptocurrency started getting adoption in 2015, 2016. Have you heard of Kharsha Dmata? Have you heard of Dau Debraham? Have you heard of like, you know, Al-Kaeda? Right. Where do you think that those terrorist organizations are wiped? This is why one like, you know, Bitcoin money right now. Right. So the point that is useless debate. OK. So what I'm trying to tell you, the message that I'm trying to give you is that see if the government has a very clear system of taxing on something. They will allow that asset class to survive. If they don't have a very clear system of controlling taxes on it, they will not do it. OK. So why do you think that the US government is allowing like BTC ETF and something like coin this because it improves the ease of buying, right? Their government is somewhat sensible. They know that if you ban things and illegal market comes up where you will lose all your tax revenues, right? For example, exactly same thing can happen in the US also. If people, if you want to buy Bitcoin, you can buy Bitcoin. OK. And any place. That's not a problem. OK. For example, for example, DPSR people right out of the students, drugs are illegal in India. But class 12 students can buy drugs right through their punwadi, right or whatever. And if you don't trust me, go and meet like DPSR people from students. So you'll see that. OK. So yeah, Gujarat alcohol, right? So the point is that this is common sense that if you ban something, underground market develops and people still buy it. US understands it. And therefore what they have done it, that's easy. People are going to buy it anyways. OK. But at least this way, right? When we are making ease of operation, transparent, you can buy coin based through the way you buy stocks, you buy crypto. We don't mind. OK. There is like a black rock developed ETF by that. OK. What they are doing is that at least they are getting some taxes out of it. OK. It's not 100% right? I hope that this point is clear. India is operating right now from a slightly more closed mindset on it. Right. Now, how does this relate to the stock market? Now what happens is that now you need to ask a question. That's the if the government, the only thing that the government cares about it taxes, then why would they let the stock market survive? Because government collects crazy amount of taxes from stock market. OK. Now why? Because when is tax collected? When there is transaction. OK. If you for example buy a real estate land. Right. Let's say in 2025. You pay your 9% stand duty. And you hold it till 2100. And the property taxes zero. Right. So how much 75 years? Tax did the government make from you? Very less nothing. OK. But how many people you know who will hold a stock for 75 years? Very few. OK. No one. What will you say? Now you decide to do it. 20 years later, I mean to increase the transaction volume, they will say, yes, SWB can not do it. They will go to the ad. Right. And whatever. So then SWB can not. SWB can not. Very important. This is that stuff. Point being that government will only make money when you transact. OK. So for example, if you do futures and options, you are paying crazy amount of money. If you trade, you are paying even more money because you are then paying 20% STCG. If you book profits, you are paying capital gains tax. Now every day, price is being highlighted in front of you in the stock market. So the transaction volume on stocks is massive. OK. And the transaction volume on real estate is very less. Now recently, a law came into effect right on real estate that there used to be indexation benefits on real estate, which is being taken away. Right. And why do you think that that is the case? That what was the meaning of indexation? That if you buy a land at, let's say, 1 crore in 2025, and you hold it until 20, 2100. So in 75 years, there is also inflation. OK. So whatever the value of the land, let's say from 1 crore, it goes to 1,000 crore. At least 650 crores of that is through inflation itself. So you will get that offset. OK. So that was the meaning of indexation. What has the Indian government done? They have taken this benefit of it. And what have they announced? That's see, we are doing fair taxation. So put same, same equity real estate all has to be done on the same podium, 12 and a half. So we are doing you a favor. OK. Why was this done to increase the transaction volume on real estate? Because if I just buy real estate, P9% stand duty, hold it for 75 years. Government has lost money on that asset in a way. But if I sell it every five years, if I sell it to you, you sell it to third person, third person, third person, third to fourth person, then instead of 9%, government is making how much? 36% on four transactions. Are you getting? OK. And therefore, right now, I'm not saying that stocks will forever be great, but at least for the next three to five years, that's my only window. My viewpoint should change after five years also as I evolve. But in the next five years, the likely scenario is that all the asset class will become like investible. It's not as if that government wants like has some special affinity to stock markets. It's just that transacting volume on stock market is huge. And government made crazy taxation money from them. So therefore, they allow it to survive. And they want it to survive and thrive. And therefore, if and to answer the question, and let me talk about money making equation here also. So for example, yeah. So for example, if you're buying this dip, you can pretty much be sure that this 11%, so I'll be the 11% gear right? And basically, if it goes up to its previous high, right? How much returns will you make? You will make 13% returns from tomorrow. OK, so this 13% return is free money lying on the table as long as you have three years holding period. Why? Because there is no chance or there is a very less probability like less than like 5% that there will be a secular decline on India's stock market. OK. And if you have that confidence, this level of confidence, which I gave you in the last 20 minutes, what should you do tomorrow? Like be 100% invested like on 1995% invested right now 10, 15% alpha is good. No problem. And as long as you can go through little bit of pain, you'll be fine. OK. So the only thing that we worry about is volatility. And if you understand why volatility is happening, why it will be solved. There are counter buyers. After the 10 crore like you'll get right for FI idea is there like you know, 10,000, 20,000, 30,000 crore. So for them, keeping the stock market alive is a much bigger headache, right? I would say that tomorrow, right? I mean, if you're just buying nifty, 50, right? And you can buy an asset called as nifty bees and I have to buy BWS. OK. That's an asset that you can
