==================================================

SUMMARY:
**  
The speaker shares their approach to lifestyle goals, financial planning, and investment strategies. They prioritize owning properties in locations they enjoy (e.g., Thailand) while being frugal in other areas (e.g., avoiding luxury cars or clothes). Their investment philosophy focuses on high-quality assets at reasonable prices, with a flexible portfolio split between index funds and direct stocks (sometimes up to 90% in stocks). They emphasize understanding assets deeply, preparing for market downturns (e.g., a 20% drop in Google), and avoiding overhyped trends like gold. They also discuss the risks in small/mid-cap stocks in India, preferring unlisted companies with strong branding. Additionally, they highlight the importance of cash flow properties for financial flexibility, including leveraging them during market crashes for opportunistic investing.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Lifestyle Goals:** Prioritize spending on experiences and properties (e.g., homes in Thailand) while cutting costs elsewhere (e.g., minimal spending on cars/clothes).  
- **Investment Strategy:**  
  - Flexibility: Adjusts portfolio between index funds and direct stocks (up to 90% in stocks for high-conviction opportunities).  
  - Focus on Quality: Buys high-quality assets at decent prices, with a clear exit strategy (e.g., stopping investment if a stock falls 20%).  
  - Avoid Hype: Ignores overhyped assets (e.g., bullish gold sentiment) targeting 15â€“20% returns through disciplined growth investments.  
- **Risk Management:**  
  - Skepticism toward small/mid-cap Indian stocks due to governance issues; prefers unlisted companies with visible founders (e.g., Oyo).  
  - Uses rental properties for steady cash flow and as collateral to capitalize on market downturns (mortgage leverage).  
- **Market Outlook:**  
  - Expects Nifty to consolidate or depreciate (not crash severely) unless India faces structural decline.  
  - Advocates for tax arbitrage and sentiment analysis to enhance returns.  
- **Advanced Tactics:**  
  - Employs leveraged financing during crashes (e.g., 2020) but stresses avoiding over-leverage (debt capped at 2.5x cash flow).  
  - Balances frugality with strategic spending to maintain portfolio growth.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
honestly, I recently started adding like lifestyle Goals to my living right so for example the lifestyle goal is that for example I own a house in Thailand, okay, so I love I like Thailand, which I have a house there. I like south. I have a house there I have a place so this place is rented, okay, so this is like a very nice apartment, right? So I live here maybe six months right a year, right? It's my family lives there six months, but you know, rents are poory then you are the Salwar Geek, right? So that's wasteful expense, right? But because I can take it so it's okay with me, okay? Now many of you will say that you have to be here when we go to the other and like the way you didn't all that When you have a so this is like my luxury, right? So this is where I spend money on I don't spend money on cars and No clothes, I don't know how to pay for a lot of Japan and all that stuff So I don't bother too much. I just buy like Thai Kurtha and Indian Kurtha's that's it, right? So I have like you know 30 of these type of P-shirts and that's it, right? So like it's Simple, right? It's simple to pick so that is my expense, right? Come in traveling from one place to the next I enjoyed doing that because it's also aligned with my work Okay, so I get to meet like a lot of investors It enhances my knowledge. So It might look expensive actually are spending like one one and a half sr a year like living this lifestyle But I'm still frugal for example. I did not rent a property in Dubai, okay? I rented a property in charge of now if I were to rent this property in Dubai I would be spending close to like two crores just on property rent not getting okay with this type of view But in charge, I'll get it at one fourth to the bride of the thing Okay, so it's like you know awesome, right? So I'm still frugal, right? But I have a very good understanding of how much money can I expense and still retain my portfolio and somewhat grow it Okay, so that's the idea of retirement So I hope that that gives you a sense or insight into retirement planning, okay? Now for me therefore targeting this 15 20 percent is pretty good Okay, so I would say that if you are making 14 15 percent returns Excellent. There is nothing wrong in 15 20 percent returns. It can be done in a very sustainable healthy way, okay? Now here what is the first thing you need to have at least 30 to 50 percent portfolio exposure directly in stocks Okay, so for me I do like 50 50 50 percent index and 50 percent direct stocks Now if there are excellent opportunities, I'll go to 90 percent direct stocks also. I do not mind doing that So I'm very flexible, right? And for me, it's always about buying high quality asset at a decent price That's what I'm more interested in. I'm index agnostic. I am Stock agnostic, okay? So that is very important, okay? Number two, I always think about KC boss. My other money is like this now, okay? Right, so for example, I buy Google right now, I percent, okay? So I'm building like close to a two million dollar portfolio in the US So if I that's the rough amount so how much can I invest so I can invest a very brief 100k on Google, okay, so I'll I'll always have the back of my mind that if Google falls by 20 percent from my By-Price, what is it that I will do? Okay, and having the answer that I will stop investing in Google is also good answer Okay, there's nothing wrong, okay? Because if it falls for example, I'm buying Google mostly at 28 percent down, okay? If it corrects by another 20 percent, this is my stop loss in a way, right? I will not invest beyond this I might even pull out money after this looking at the business side of the equation if that kind of makes sense But always have a prep strategy of handling this 20 percent fall and this 20 percent fall strategy only comes into the equation If you truly understand the asset that you are buying which brings us to a very interesting conversation that do you think that nifty will fall um Buy more than 50 60 percent Because you're buying it and I'm minus 16 now right? So 36 percent fall be over the ball very follow the so do you think that nifty will fall by 36 37 percent From its top I don't think so what is a more likely scenario That nifty goes sideways. I and R depreciates, okay? So your real return is still 0 or maybe negative But nifty fall in absolute terms you will not see At minus what the even if that happens there will be a sharp v-shaped recovery the way it happened in 2020 Okay, so that's the Thesis now when does this thesis change on nifty 50 If If India is in a secular decline, okay? So for example, flaws are not functioning and all that stuff right? I mean a lot of like complications so if India is in a secular decline There is no growth happening at all right It's becoming a really bad emerging market even marketing is not working It is right now one good thing about India is that we market things really well right? So that's great for investors There is like a massive marketing team at Kujibir, the UPI by the way, I mean Dubai which function in the years because I'm a UPI near right so like that's the image that I had before coming to you Dubai, the Dubai, I'm going to any card what could be in the world and just Low at the same time, say, it's like cash Nikolai Katskar, they're not all that By Dubai does not require UPI payments because I credit card works everywhere, okay? So credit debit cards, okay? So we do you do not require it, okay? So that's the bottom line, right? But the point is that it's great marketing, okay? But if the marketing stops then that I don't know like that's a point of Contention, okay, but I hope that this point is clear Here some advanced techniques that you need to definitely do is capital rotation Sentiment analysis for example today there is a lot of bullish sentiment on gold. So am I buying gold? No Why because my target rate is 1520 percent growth So gold does not form a part of my growth asset anymore at this juncture, okay? I cannot expect to buy like extremely great sentiment everyone is running after that asset Then I'm chasing an uptrend right? I mean and here the chances of a loss is very high or a chance of a consolidation It will definitely not give like 15 20 percent run up, okay? On a long term basis So I will not touch this, okay? Now you'll say that okay. I want to generate like 20 percent What is it that I need to do? Okay, then I will say that you have to have a lot of small midi cap unlisted Exposure you need to basically have approximately like 40 to 50 percent at least Exposure to these two x3x stocks. They can come from unlisted segments They can come from small and mid cap segments. It can be small and mid cap index Now at this stage, I'm not very confident of picking small and mid cap companies in India It's very very speculative now. Why because there's a lot of dhanle bhaji and you know non opaque information on small cap Midi cap stocks Jen Sol being a latest example net outright the entire book Is like cooked up, okay? In a way same thing happened with With a company called as bright com group you can search so I made a video right even before sebi had Audited the form right so I made a public video explaining how Bright form is running a scam, okay? So you can search akshad bright com and you will see that video So there are massive corporate governance issues in small and mid cap companies, okay? So I will only have handful of those companies What I've started warming up is the idea of unlisted stocks for example At least like like Ritesh Agrawalke kuch to publiclaces, right? I mean if Oyo does some scam at least the founder is publicly visible He'll get a lot of it hit, okay NSE right. I mean it's a good unlisted company, right? So if something weird happens with the company at least there is like someone liable Of Jen Sol kuch karkinikal jai right now for an adding up, you know xyz pipe company does something weird It's very difficult, right? So therefore I have started looking at like More visible slash table business with brand value if you can buy them early it kind of makes sense, okay? So for example swing right now that's a very well known company well good face And still not publicly listed so I bought it then, okay? So I would rather do like I would rather consider unlisted space as small cap mid cap space And it kind of makes sense right from that angle. So I will add whenever I get an opportunity to do that, okay? Uh, okay tax arbitrage is these are great because this automatically jacks up my return to like instead of 15% Now I start making 18% which is great and free focus on a right so that's really good, okay? Managing cash flows this is very important this I've started realizing more that having rental income having Cash flow properties it allows me to do two things number one. It allows me to buy things on a downtrend because I'm getting Consistent cash, okay? And that's one second. I can mortgage these assets in a complete crash and raise money against it Because these are income generating assets you got my second point that for example if I have Let's say 10 properties across goa and Dubai and my debt is zero Then where do you think I can take debt? You know 2020 crash like situation I can go to a bank say very many properties. I have an excellent credit history Give me like I guess my 20 properties 20 grow loans now. What do you think I'll do with that loan? I'll buy 20 more properties, okay? So like that's what I would do, okay? So I'm waiting is that you give a little crash. I so then this is called as mortgage Leveraged financing. This is what I do on my hedge fund to be honest, right and It's high risk high reward game, right? But this only makes sense if you're not over leveraged, right? So for example If my cash flow for example is let's say you know, here is let's say 20 gross then the maximum debt that I will take is like you know 50 gross, right? So that's Yeah, so that's what I will
