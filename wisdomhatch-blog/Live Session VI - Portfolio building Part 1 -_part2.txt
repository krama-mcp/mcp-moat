SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses portfolio diversification, sentiment analysis in investing, and market cycles. It emphasizes investing small percentages (e.g., 5%) in major tech companies like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft for diversification, as their long-term stability is assured. The author explains sentiment analysis as a human-centric skill, contrasting it with AI capabilities, and highlights the importance of identifying trends early (e.g., learning AI/ML now). The text also covers market phases (crash, buildup, greed, euphoria) and advises aligning investments with these cycles. It concludes with a focus on long-term (3–5 year) investing, avoiding short-term all-in bets, and balancing portfolios geographically (e.g., India vs. US markets).

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Diversification:** Allocate small portions (e.g., 5%) to stable tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Microsoft to mitigate risk.  
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Human-driven understanding of market emotions is crucial; AI cannot fully replicate this.  
- **Trend Identification:** Early adoption of emerging trends (e.g., AI/ML) can yield significant long-term advantages.  
- **Market Cycles:** Markets move through phases—crash, buildup, greed, euphoria—which investors should study to time decisions.  
- **Long-Term Focus:** A 3–5 year investment horizon helps navigate volatility and align with cyclical patterns.  
- **Avoid All-In Bets:** Resist short-term, high-risk investments; instead, balance portfolios across assets and regions (e.g., India/US).  
- **Contrarian Opportunities:** Unique, contrarian strategies (e.g., arbitrage) or consistent systematic investing can outperform crowded trends.  
- **Historical Patterns:** Analyzing past cycles (e.g., 2008 crash, 2020 rebound) provides insights for future market behavior.  
- **Technical Analysis:** Use tools like trendlines (support/resistance) to inform entry/exit points while maintaining a diversified approach.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
g that go and over invest in this but having like maybe 5% of exposure to Google 5% of exposure to Amazon 5% of exposure to Microsoft makes sense in a diversified format. If you throw the question at me that tell me whether Google will win this particular race or Microsoft I don't know okay but one of the following companies only will win okay that's like pretty given these companies are not going anywhere in the next 3 to 5 years okay so I hope that this point is clear to everyone okay all right okay so this was quantitative sorry this was business analysis now let me talk about like portfolio building on this class right and sentiment analysis this is something that I wanted to quickly touch up on okay now sentiment analysis is something that chat GPT or LLMs cannot do because this has to do with human sentiments okay simplest things in the world generate the most powerful results not now but from time in memorial okay for example what is the simplest thing in the world in let's say if you're building a career in 1990s what should you have done well learn coding learn IT okay that was great why because this trend was starting okay in 2025 what is it the simplest thing that you can do to win in the world yeah right so I mean if you learn AI ML all that stuff if you are 17 18 20 year old right focusing here makes a lot more sense if you are in early like 2000s right what should you have done right MBA was a great kind of an option but if you zoom out and step back and see what what is happening like you know from a structure point of view well the point is that doing these things early kind of made sense okay now what does that means that if everyone is going this way you go this way okay what is the worst thing that you can do like I mean or what I see like a lot of people in their late 20s early 30s what's the number one career mistake that you made I don't even need to take up all doing engineering comes feature at the top of your list is it all is it not okay so why because out of so there was like Zachary Khan's stand-up comedy up is up so I'm borrowing this line from there that out of four people or four meals in India five are engineers okay so which is actually true okay so that is actually true right why because if so many engineers are there what's the value of engineering nothing right so that's the bottom line right so you have to do something unique so sentiment is what like you have to be an intelligent contrarian then only well this built okay either you build build well by you doing arbitrage now what is arbitrage the seno okay casinos from time in immemorial have been minting money why because the house always wins this or whatever like this jume last started like long time ago and it still kind of works go to last Vegas casino capital go to Macau casino capital Chinese people love to gamble mainland China I don't think gambling is allowed right so they go to Macau they burn money you wait right strike like gambling is strictly prohibited by religion so what is the workaround that Dubai slash away yes figure it out and main cardinilla land we are doing it on sea bottom right so that's the thing okay so we are doing like building like Russell came a casino on see okay so that is win casino which is there like let go okay so no goa there is a casino online it's called Zwarri White Sands right so it's in warka right I have a bottom of first property there so it's like walkable took from there okay I have never been to like you know Zwarri White Sands but I'm just telling you okay so Zuri White Sands something like this right so that's that okay so so the bottom line being that you either make money through arbitrage which is casino gambling dream 11 astrology and the book the right and all that stuff right so I mean these are like religion right so this is like arbitrage okay or you do by being contraivian these are your two options okay so there is no third option third is consistent compounding for example if you do everything as a system right then you make money right because other people are finding it difficult to invest in a system so on that note how do we relate this knowledge to the stock market so for this you need to study phases in the stock market stock market goes through the following phase okay so number one phase is there is some kind of crash okay number two and whenever there is crash there is panic associated with it okay number two there is built up okay built up everything is demolished now people start building up okay then there is euphoria okay greed right we greed moves into euphoria within a few moments okay okay in fact there is greed third stage four stages euphoria okay and this is crash now can we study this yes pick or decade yes let's pick 2020 right the easiest one 2020 over it crash what happened massive panic almost 35% drop on FT after that 2021 2022 built up right everyone what excited about stock markets there was greed in 2022 one could say euphoria and after that there was another mini crash okay that happened by 2022 okay so this was the cycle now this cycle goes went faster okay now if I show this to you on a chart just a minute show this to you on a chart okay so if we go right and let's study like S&P 500 so Indian stocks can we you can do it you can do it you can do it not at all okay anything that you like so let's go to 2008 right so this was 2008 now this was like this was a crash right built up by this time there was euphoria 2004 selected 2009 seven years of great return everyone is into the stock market right then there was a crash now again euphoria right went up went up went up and then there is a crash okay so the point is that there is always like these phases when there is a crash followed by built up followed by euphoria followed by a crash okay so if you have to just simply plot it okay and this is what your sentiment chart means okay now this happens on short term basis this happens on long term basis and if you purely time your investment decisions based on that you will be fine okay this is probably the most powerful thing right and which has got nothing to do with finance but still everything to do with finance okay now what type of phase are we in right now is this euphoria is this greed no like I would say built up okay so so yeah so basically now what happens is that people think that this always like the first thing needs to leads to second thing leads to third thing no basically it can fluctuate also right so for example there is crash right crash is clear okay then the market dipped okay second is built up okay third is greed okay fourth is euphoria okay and then there is crash okay now what happens is that what is happening now is that see there was a very clear crash in 2020 then market started to getting rebuilt right then 20 then greed euphoria happened right and then there was a mini crash okay mini crash okay then we went to build up right immediately right then built up there was a greed right then there was a little bit of crash minus 10 percent then again we went into build up okay so it works like this okay so for example if right now we try to see that is this like um people are like you know increasing their SIPs decreasing their SIP what is happening etc etc then then we can get an estimate now how to calculate all this okay so that's an interesting question so let me try to do this and the easiest way is to figure out your time horizon of investing because greed euphoria etc only works when your time horizon is clear and for this you need to know the type of an investor you are for example I am a 3 to 5 air investor okay now what do I mean by 3 to 5 air it means that's it today if I'm putting like one lakh rupees in the market I am okay holding it till 2028 okay does this mean that I will definitely hold it till 2028 no right I'm gonna go a pathraba liqueh dodiya right I mean it's not like that right so if I get an opportunity to book profit I'll do it but at least till 2028 I don't need this money okay so I'll put it in the stock market and see what happens okay whatever decisions I'm taking I'm taking it on a three-year basis okay now for this you need to study number one the asset that you are analyzing so here what asset are we analyzing here we are analyzing S&P 500 which is the broad market index now if you are analyzing Nasdaq that is a tech index both of them work differently okay similarly if you are analyzing small cap index it will work differently then nifty 50 so on and so forth everyone with me okay all right now what I would say is that if you have to do sentiment analysis right on a 3 to 5 air basis the longer your horizon the easier it gets okay so for example a 3 to 5 air investor will think like this that hey see right now this is if I look at technicals so I'll analyze like weekly candle first weekly and monthly candles I'll do this analysis weekly candle what can I see that hey this is a channel that was being formed and I had sent this homework so I hope that you guys did it how could draw trend lines so I'm not speaking about that this is resistance this is support what is likely to happen is that this will touch this this will fall and this channel is likely to be respected okay so here should I add anything maybe if I'm undervalued S&P 500 depending on my portfolio for example let's say my portfolio is once he are it relax in India 20 lacks in the US okay I want to transfer this portfolio into the US so that could be one of my goals okay so what I might want a picture of my portfolio is 60% to you India and 40 like US okay so this is what I want to do now here is the S&P 500 somewhat sensible for me yes okay so yes I know because I want to anyways put more money okay but what should I definitely not do I should not go all in okay at least on a short term basis everyone understand why not go all in what is an all-in point all-in point is this okay maybe okay even here you should not go all
