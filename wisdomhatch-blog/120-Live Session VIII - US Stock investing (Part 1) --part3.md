SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses stock trading strategies, focusing on breakouts, patterns like the "cup with handle," and avoiding speculative parabolic rises. It emphasizes buying stocks during breakouts to avoid time corrections, setting selling targets using technical patterns, and warns against chasing overvalued stocks in parabolic trends. The author also highlights the risks of pure price speculation and the importance of combining technical analysis with fundamentals. Real-world examples (e.g., ITC, HDFC Bank, Brightcom) illustrate these principles, stressing disciplined investing over gambling-like behavior.

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
- **Breakouts signal trend changes**: Buying during breakouts helps avoid prolonged consolidations and capitalizes on upward momentum.  
- **Technical patterns guide selling**: Tools like the "cup with handle" or "reverse head and shoulders" help set selling targets by measuring pattern depth.  
- **Avoid parabolic rises**: Chasing stocks in speculative, parabolic trends (e.g., Brightcom’s 95% crash) often leads to losses; fundamentals should override FOMO.  
- **Fundamentals + technicals**: Blend fundamental analysis (e.g., revenue/profit growth) with technicals for better decision-making, especially in overvalued markets.  
- **Discipline over speculation**: Reject "Russian roulette" trading (pure price speculation) and adhere to a systematic investing approach.  
- **Selling triggers**: Trend exhaustion, portfolio rebalancing, or liquidity needs are valid reasons to sell; avoid emotional or speculative exits.  
- **Long-term patience**: Stocks like HDFC Bank may consolidate for years before delivering pent-up gains; avoid impatience with fundamentally sound investments.  

**Notable Examples:**  
- ITC’s 10-year breakout led to significant gains, illustrating breakout potential.  
- Brightcom’s parabolic rise and 95% crash exemplifies speculative danger.  
- Dubai real estate analogy warns against off-plan purchases purely betting on price appreciation.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 okay here it has The stock price has moved up and it has sustained. Okay, which means what? That it is likely to change this trading channel, long term trading channel. Now it might become like this. It might become like, for example, this. And this is a likely channel which might get formed now. Okay, so it might move like this. Okay, so this is whenever a breakout happens, that's a good time to buy a stock. Okay, why? Because then you are avoiding a time correction. Okay, so this is the pivot point. And this might be the last chance for you to catch it before this trade runs. Okay, so this is what the concept of breakout tells us. Now within this also, there are multiple types of pattern, right? Because for example, then you will be considering a chart. For example, if I catch the breakout now, where do I sell the stock? So this pattern, this looks like a cup with handle. Okay, so this gives you a selling target. So for example, what you do is that you take this depth of this cup. Okay, and you stick it here. Okay, now I'm not able to move the Y access for some reason. My trading view is malfunctioning. And whatever price point comes here. Okay, so you will be able to sell it there. Okay, so whatever that number comes out to be, it's not working for me to some reasons. Ah, now it's working. Yeah. Working, I don't know, I don't know, like so whatever. Uh, I'll draw there. So. So this is the concept of cup with handle. Everyone got it. Okay, so this is. It is a variant of this is called as reverse head and shoulder and all that stuff. We don't need to get into like extreme technicals, right? When major technicals have already taught you. So this is like this gives you a selling target. This roughly, you know, the chart, you know, the way to sell it. Okay, and technical traders will definitely sell it around this. Okay, won't you. Fundamental and elemental. It's a coroni, but they were right. For example, we are mostly fundamental investors. We use technicals as a support technical people are technical people. They will have a lot of stock, right? So when we only will trade on price, right? So that's what. No, so breakout is a great time to buy a stock, not sell a stock. Okay, why? Which means that a channel trend is changing. Okay. So if you're entering into a stock for the next three years, a breakout has happened. Now when breakouts happen, the stock runs quite a lot, right? So for example, just say, ah, if you go, right? So for example, if you make something like ITC breakout, it's not a good one, right? So ITC limited. And this was a 10 year consolidation, like from here to, sorry, not 10 years, but whatever. So this, if you draw like resistance support, it will look like this. Okay. And this is a breakout. Okay, so if you buy it here, right? So you would have bought it at like more whatever, like 280. And technically you could have ridden the entire trend and sold it at whatever, like I ran at least 14 with a beachy day. Okay. And this game came really fast. Okay. So the idea, you actually make profits by capturing these type of things. Did I was able to make profits here? No, right? Bye because I was more of a fundamental guy back in like 2022, game, technicals, will call using it and all that stuff. I'm out of the speculative market. So it's important to use technicals now. So therefore I started using technicals little bit more in conjunction with macros. Okay. So, okay. I've seen you time frame for the clue. There is no header like to this because a stock can consolidate for four, five years also. If they want HDFC bank to consolidate for another two years, it will consolidate. But the point is that whatever pent up gain is there, for example, inherent return of HDFC bank should be 13, 14% a year. Okay. That's the type of profit is generates on early basis. Now that 13, 14% gain will not come in the FD form that every year you are getting like that 13% in your account. No, you might have to wait with HDFC for five more years. Who knows? In the sixth year, 12 times five, 60% gains might come. Okay. So for example, 40% gains gain this year itself. Okay. So yeah, so that's the bottom line. Okay. I hope that this is clear to everyone. Okay. Now some patterns to avoid. Right. So for example, just say, have they closed. Right. Okay. Now, when will you lose money by chasing technicals? So whenever you see this barabolic rise, this and you are late to this parabolic rise. For example, what do I mean by late? So let's assume that you are here. Okay. That 3000. Okay. Should you buy trend as a fundamental guy here? Okay. You check three or five year 10 year basis in context of its revenue growth, profit growth, etc. You make an assessment if it looks overvalued and the technical pattern looks like a parabolic rise, you avoid. You do not chase it. Don't chase like whatever like that. Film it. I was in like bus running bus train girls, whatever. Right. So don't do that. Okay. So it's like true. Okay. So this is the simple point. Okay. So don't do this. You will lose money. Right. By this time, it's gone. Now it has gone into a speculative stage and you are speculating. Okay. On a price increase. That's the worst type of bet. It's too thick. Okay. For example, right? If you're buying under construction properties right now in Dubai, you are speculating. Okay. Why? Because the only thesis of buying right and there are like signs for example, typically you have to be. Okay. Under construction for example, I bought a property in Dubai and I got a PSF of 1600 PSF. Okay. I bought it in the next four or five weeks. I was able to rent it. So my cash flow started there. Now properties are getting sold in business base in area at 3000 PSF. So you lock in you pay like 20% down payment or whatever it is and you keep on making installment and you get that property after three years. So you are getting an off plan property that is an under construction property after three years and you are paying to X the PSF. Now what is that? That is speculation. Okay. Who is buying that? Those type of properties. I was saying you know what was. Kabhi Dubai market. Neechanini. So let's just speculate. Okay. Same things happen with stocks. So people who are who trade purely on price. Kiar. Mehz, I was able to make like you know at 20% return in like one month. So I'll also jump in right. So this is MLN marketing. Okay. So now then you'll go bankrupt doing this. Why? Because maybe you will make money once. Okay. You will invest in trend. You will exit with like 20% gains or whatever. Then what you will do next? Again, look for these type of stocks only. You do not have any system of investing. There is no head or leg to this system. You are just speculating purely on price and that's like Russian. Raleigh, right? So Russian. Raleigh simply means that there is like a gun, right? Revolver six chambers. You put one bullet, spin the revolver, put it on your head, click. Okay. You are saved. So you'll assume that you are always going to be safe. No. Okay. And this is a genuine thing. Right? I'm in Trashame if you go and someone offers you vodka. Right. I think then they might make you play Russian. No, I'm kidding. Okay. It's not. Okay. But you will hear such stories. Okay. So I hope that this is clear. That please avoid these type of and there are hundreds such examples. Right. So for example, bright comb. Right. So this is a manipulated stock. Okay. So you will see. Okay. So for example, this is completely parabolic. Okay. It went up here. 170 and literally like came to 10 rupees. Okay. So it got corrected by 95%. Okay. So it's not even like that. Right. And. And. And. Right. And for example, yes, bang. And be as opposed to what I don't know. Maybe. You will you cannot call this parabolic. Okay. So this is not parabolic. This is like rice. This is not like, you know, like that. Right. So here we were. Right. And. But that's a one on you. Right. So there is no point. Right. Right. So. So. So for example, this is almost parabolic, okay. So this this run up from March 23 to this. This is parabolic. Okay. So March 24. So. Stock went to 2.5 x at such large market cap. This is crazy. Okay. Avoid. If you have missed that run up, then just simply avoid. Okay. So there is no way for us to understand this. Okay. You should not speculate on such. Right. That's not. Okay. You should not speculate on such stocks. A lot of stocks will be there. So I'll leave it up to you. Right. I mean, how you judge it. Uh, my voice is okay. Uh, okay. I hope my internet is okay now. Okay. Okay. Yeah. So cool. So there are a lot of such stocks. Right. So there's no point in me like, you know, taking you through that list. Okay. maximum. So that is incentive, but it is never gonna go through Vкам. One of them I'm telling you. Will bring, aren't we? We need to be able to point forward. Hopefully. Okay. We want to assess your target service. Okay. You know, last week, I was, having my major 이거를 and for a few weeks, we have some Animal feed reward these week. Against también benefits. This program shows when we have these Koreans Except, We don't want them to give us the prices. This happened at small cap mid cap market itself made no sense. Okay number three There is the trend has been exhausted Okay, so for example we are on an uptrend and that trend exhaustion has taken place because those curves have changed so you Sell it. Okay number four. You are trying to move your portfolio or reject your portfolio Which means what that for example? I'll tell you how much you're looking for The June lagare then a vessel here and I'm not equal to sell also so I want to shift my money from mutual fund to direct stocks So then you start slow you first cut 20% of positions in mutual funds. You buy direct stocks, whichever stocks you like, okay? So that's another reason to sell Final point is you sell because you need money. Okay, so that's completely okay here you start with selling overval
