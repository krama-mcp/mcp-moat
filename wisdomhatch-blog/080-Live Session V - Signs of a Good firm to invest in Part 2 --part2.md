SUMMARY:
**  
The text discusses the drawbacks of investing in stocks primarily for dividends, highlighting the double taxation issue (corporate tax + personal income tax). It emphasizes the importance of investing in companies with stable regulations (e.g., Indian banks over crypto or gaming sectors), low dependency on single clients (e.g., avoiding IT firms reliant on the US market), and pricing power. The author advises favoring domestic businesses with consistent growth (e.g., stock exchanges) and warns against sectors with unstable regulations or economic vulnerability (e.g., middle-class-focused industries declining due to economic pressures).  

**

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
**  
1. **Dividends are tax-inefficient**: Profits are taxed at the corporate level and again as personal income, making dividend-focused investing suboptimal.  
2. **Regulatory stability matters**: Prefer industries with clear, stable regulations (e.g., banking) over volatile sectors like crypto or gaming.  
3. **Avoid client concentration risk**: Companies overly reliant on one client or market (e.g., IT firms dependent on the US) face higher risks.  
4. **Domestic consumption stories are safer**: Invest in businesses tied to India’s growing economy (e.g., NSE, CDSL) with low cyclicality.  
5. **Pricing power is critical**: Economic downturns (e.g., middle-class shrinkage) hurt discretionary spending; prioritize essential goods/services.  
6. **Diversify sensibly**: Limit exposure to high-risk bets (e.g., 1–2% of portfolio) and focus on stable core holdings.  
7. **Sector-specific risks**: Unregulated or politically sensitive industries (e.g., EVs, autonomous driving) face unpredictable regulatory hurdles.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
 benefits to shareholders see this automatically happens at the stock price is good. So this is done either through dividends. Now many people get excited you know I LITC gives like 7% 7 and a half percent dividends all that stuff. Why see companies not doing you any a son by giving you dividends. Okay, so that's point one. In fact, dividend if you're buying stocks for dividend. You'll be taxed at the highest slab and you will be taxed twice. Now what is how how does that up. Okay, so for example, I skip any profit but negating profit. Okay, so for example, this company made 411 crores of profit. Now the company will pay whatever like 25% tax in India. Okay, now they are down to like whatever 350 crores. I believe. Okay, now out of these 350 crores, the company will decide that's easy. We will set up like two factories. So this is called as Kpex capital expenditure of the company to put two more factories. So that it can expand its business. Okay, so they will take like 100 crores here. Okay, they are left with 250 crores. So they are going to return this to shareholders. Right, so for example, if you want if there are only 100 shareholders, then each one like 11% and everyone gets 2.5 crore of dividend. Right, for that year and on that you'll have to pay slab tax. Okay, so how many times did you get taxed twice? Okay, so is dividend planning smart strategy? Absolutely not. Okay, never buy stocks for dividend. It's worst strategy to buy like stocks for dividend. Okay, there are ways to get dividend. As more says, no, you cannot get dividends. That's company's decision. That is not your decision. For example, if the company has no reinvestment opportunity, for example, Balram Churpur Chini guy says that you know what, I am doing it. I am doing it. I am doing it. But I have to ask for like my company rules. I have to distribute like whatever profits are remaining. If I can't reinvest, what will I do? I will have to like either do stock buy back, do not go any longer. I can then you know, distribute it as dividend. So, of course, if they do, right, whatever you want to do, give it that money. Right, so that's what is happening. Okay. Yes, so company buy back in the US is more prominent than that in India. Why is that the case? That's an interesting question for even me to solve. Yes, I don't know. Yes, so what I'll have to think. Right. So, okay, cool. I hope that this point is clear to everyone. Less prone to regulations. Regulations. Stable. Okay, so this is a very important point that the regulations on a business should be stable. Okay. So, for example, when it comes to banks, now are the regulations a lot? Yes. Okay, but are the regulations stable? Primarily yes. Okay, what about cryptos? Are the regulations a lot? I don't know. Are the regulations stable? Absolutely not. Okay, we are far away from like creating a bit of all that stuff. So, any crypto oriented business, if it gets listed in India, should you buy it right now? Absolutely not. Okay. It's a problem. Right. So, this is a complete opposite. What about gaming? Great industry. Growing out like almost 30% C.A.G.R. in India. Right. Dream 11. One of the most profitable startups. More people make teams on dream 11 than total mutual fund investing. Okay. So, they are more profitable than that. Right. Huge humongous company. Right. Again, there is a reliance collection or a money connection if you know, like dream 11. I don't know. Like if you guys know the search. Okay. So, you'll get more insights on how we are turning into like a monopoly. Okay. So, just read about like who runs like dream 11 along that. Okay. So, anyways. So, here is it stable. The short answer is no, it is not stable. They will they are fiddling around, but this is a highly profitable industry. Now, am I advising you not to buy these type of stocks? It's your call. Right. But the point is that for example, as a rule, I don't invest more than 5% even on companies like HDFC, HUL and all that. Okay. How much do you think that I'll buy something like let's say Delta Corp? Maybe like 1% to 2% of my entire portfolio. That's it. Okay. So, this is called as sensible investing. Right. I've been fine. It's okay to be handled. Right. For example, if I'll pick like maybe 10 such bets. It's fine. Right. At least even if two, three win. That's good money. Okay. But I hope you got the point. Right. The regulations have been stabilized. Right. Or it's less prone to regulation. Evie, for example, a lot of regulations are going to come on Evie. Right. If we get into autonomous driving cars, massive regulations are going to come on autonomous driving. If someone is like for example, Ola electric comes. And it says that we are going to like you know copy, Musk and we are going to make like a self driving car. Now, invest in our stocks now. Invest in our stocks now. Should you go in? Invest. No, why? Because you don't know like Adani Jeekaman, Gara, Vua, I have sky, I mean there is no end to this. Okay. Regulation as like right tapism is like crazy. Right. It kills literally stocks. Okay. So just buy like fairly stable industry, especially in a country like India. Okay. Very important. Right. When you're doing US investing, it's slightly different. Right. You can be a little bit adventurous. But given how corrupt the extent to which we are going to be. The extent to which corruption takes place like even in stock markets, it's very important for you to buy fairly stable companies in India. That's what I have realized. At least on your core portfolio. So what is core portfolio? I'll explain you tomorrow. But as a general rule of mine, right. If you're trying to identify good businesses in India, buy businesses that are somewhat regulated. Yeah. So yeah. Or where the regulation is quite clear. Okay. Okay. No dependency on one large client. Now, this is what my problem with IT industry is. But who do you think is the number one customer of IT industry or Infosys or TCS. Is US based minds. Now, if US is creating a lot of. Local businesses, which has what Trump's push has been. What do you think. Is going to happen to IT. Arms. Business. When I say one large client, it could be like a nation or it could be like one literally large corporate line. For example, in Madras and Sumis case, the large client is Maruti. Okay. So they are the primary buyers of their parts. Okay. So that's a risk that you're taking right that okay. Trump, very adventurous person. He can come and you know dictate terms to India. They have the financial muscle to do it. They are already in sourcing a lot of business to US. Some states have started to cut taxes. Complete zero taxes now. For example, today only I was reading like I think it was Mississippi or something that has cut taxes. They are on a path of making it pure capitalist economy. And they are doing well. Okay. So they are like on a positive trajectory on that note. Okay. India, we don't know. We are just waiting by time right now to react to whatever whenever we find stability. Okay. So this is not like very healthy right sign from that angle. Right. So you cannot buy like businesses, which are which have extreme dependence. Okay. What is a better strategy here? The better strategy is to buy domestic businesses, which will be. Which would not get impacted by regulations much or at least external regulations much. Okay. So for example, right banks in India now can they be regulated by the US entities? No, so like in banks are solid right. What about like something like NSE national stock exchange BSC. Bombay Stock Exchange CDSL camps these type of things right where the industrial. Time is expanding. These are low ROC is fairly high right. They don't have they don't have too much borrowings right to begin with. They will have to pass on benefits to shareholder. They are not cyclical stocks right. They are growth companies. So it's much better to buy these type of domestic consumption stories. Okay. So this is where I will just close this off. Next point that these companies should have some kind of pricing power. Okay. So now this is very important. What has happened in our economy is that basically the middle class is becoming lower middle class. Okay. And the expectation was that middle class will go to upper middle class. But they are becoming the middle class is now turning into lower middle class. So therefore you will find like a lot of delivery boys. The sector I'm not berating like any you know job. I respect all the jobs. But there's generally like if someone has done like master's degree bachelor's degree and you are like you know sort of delivering food etc. Then that just indicates desperation in the economy. That's not like a commissary job with your skillset. Okay. So people did not go to college to become like a delivery boy. Right. And that's let's be honest. Okay. So now this indicates that we are like you know moving towards that lower end right now as a result of businesses are getting hit. Okay. So this was like this is one of the primary thesis that has changed in my style of investing also that for example lot of middle class businesses. Which were pure like which would have cater to like this middle upper middle class are now going into lower end. Okay. For example, Zomato now who do you think avails Zomato service like these people lower middle class also eats food quite outside. Middle class. They also eat food quite a lot outside right. But when it comes to like let's say you know page industry products right for example jockey. Okay. So jockey is a mens underwear like a female underwear. I don't know like so basically what is happening is that see this is not like. This is not a product that you can flaunt right I mean like you would not wear underwear over your mats. Okay. So like yeah. So it's not as if that this is required right as a signalling so people will save money here if they can. Right brand does not probably matters that much okay val
