==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text is a conversational analysis of different investment options (stocks, EPF/PPF, FDs, and Nifty 50) based on criteria like liquidity, growth, cash flow, and wealth protection. The speaker critiques EPF/PPF for low post-tax returns (~8-9%) and lack of liquidity, favoring FDs for emergencies. They argue that Nifty 50 offers better long-term returns (~10-12% post-tax) and capital rotation opportunities, contrasting with passive investment myths. The speaker emphasizes the importance of timing and capital rotation, citing Warren Buffett’s cash holdings as an example of strategic market timing.

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **EPF/PPF Limitations**: Low post-tax returns (~8-9%), illiquidity, and no wealth protection make them suboptimal.  
- **FDs Over EPF/PPF**: FDs provide better liquidity for emergencies despite similar returns.  
- **Nifty 50 Advantages**: Offers higher post-tax returns (~10-12%) and opportunities to rotate capital during market cycles.  
- **Capital Rotation**: Smart investors (e.g., Warren Buffett) time markets and hold cash for opportunities, contrary to "always invest" dogma.  
- **Time Value**: Locking money long-term (e.g., EPF) misses opportunities; flexible investments like Nifty 50 allow strategic exits.  
- **Probabilistic Investing**: Markets follow trends (e.g., Bank Nifty’s channel); technical analysis can identify high-probability trades.  
- **Market Timing Myth**: Passive investing is misrepresented; even Buffett holds significant cash (~50% of portfolio) to capitalize on dips.  

*Note: The speaker’s tone is informal and opinionated, with a focus on debunking conventional wisdom using technical and tax-adjusted return comparisons.*

ORIGINAL TEXT:
t highlight this in the red yeah so this is yes okay liquidity we want right so you'll highlight this in green right growth we want so you'll highlight this in green okay what about cash flow can you make cash flow from stocks absolutely not okay so you cannot say that next month I'll be able to book like one lakh rupees from my by running SWP you are idiot right if you're thinking that SWP will run forever okay why because you don't know where to the market is if the market in one month is corrected by 15 20% will you do SWP from it okay it does not make any sense right why would you withdraw from it okay so this is a red okay wealth protection on stocks maybe okay I don't know like so for example this is not a hard asset right I mean or the hardness of the asset is debatable okay so it's like maybe so we'll just put this in blue okay now what about another let's put another bucket which is called as pf epf ppf right so this is a very touchy topic a lot of people will get angry at me but let me just try to do my best okay so okay so color change okay so okay growth how much growth will you put it as a growth asset no why because despite investing your money for 20 years 15 years 20 years it does not grow your wealth after tax basis by more than 9% agree everywhere okay because pf epf ppf does not give you more than 8 to 9% returns on a long term basis okay after tax so this gets eliminated so here we can put a cross because we are already adjusting for taxes in terms of returns okay what about liquidity is it very easy to withdraw money from epf epf if you require money tomorrow will you get it no okay it will take some months I don't know right volatile not really right so this is like a green signal right we'll put green here okay what about cash flow absolutely not okay what about wealth protection absolutely not okay so one of the worst assets to invest is pretty much vf epf ppf as a system now the moment I said I'll be yeah people will get you know people will get mad at me right but if you have a debate with me I'm happy to answer every single question that you have on this why for example is FD better or is yeah is FD better or is pf epf ppf better I would say FD because it at least gives you liquidity right for example if you require that you know whatever like two three quick money if you for example FD money where can you use okay okay passive and what is it right so for example right let's see okay so if you go right this is bank nifty okay this is a trading channel now what do you think traders will be doing so this is a trading channel that has started from 2020 on bank nifty right and it is one of the most undervalued asset okay now if you don't have requirement of your FD money for the next two years what you can potentially do what some people will potentially do I'm not asking you to do it because I'm not a CB registered advisor all that stuff I'm just generally telling you what an trader will do yeah they'll buy it here right so we are already here right so you can see this red line this was a breaking of a channel and if you just swing it right so this is called a swing trade you made how much capital you made 17% capital okay on this now you say it has a zeroi it's not going to be a little bit of a deal see I mean you know it's math it's probabilistic game investing is probability oriented now there is no personal animosity that bank nifty bank index has with you okay it has been trading in this channel for a while right since 2020 so why are you assuming that it will not go up are the chances of going up high is this more likely scenario or it down is this more likely scenario right if you are betting here then there is a 16% 17% gain to be made okay so if you invest like whatever like you know two lacropy here your code fees was ruled right and hopefully right and you are done yes or ROI okay so can you put your FD money if you don't require it for two for let's say two years yes you pot potentially can okay everyone with me right how to do this analysis decide PQ separately right on subsequent classes but what I'm trying to tell you is that when it comes to FDs right even every money right you're safe money can sometimes be used for these type of opportunities everyone okay so guys please don't try it excessively okay I'll take like maybe one question on this and then we'll take out five minute break because some of you might be you know sort of getting a little bit tired okay so we'll take a coffee right now Bharatwaj yes you have a question yeah nope you have to unmute yourself I can't hear you guys I'll take the uns questions over the end I don't matter any questions so the other last why no why wealth protection is no in ppf because what is the return after tax return on ppf 8 9% maximum 9 m allo 9 mini right let's assume 9 okay now what is the like and that's after tax okay now what is the after tax return on nifty 50 12 and that's 12 and a half 13% you will make okay and then tax you'll pay 12.5 so roughly 10 and a half percent you will make right so that's a one and a half percent difference on what basis on 10 12 15 year basis because NPS ppf also you have to log for 10 15 years and nifty also we are assuming that 10 15 years but there's a good thing about nifty okay now what is the good thing about nifty so let's say that and I'm just randomly picking nifty 50 okay and this is capital rotation okay so for example here is nifty 50 okay now let's say like pick any 10 year window you just you guys name it whatever window you want okay let's pick another random right so 2011 pick up okay 10 year window so 2011 say 2021 one-way window okay so this is 2011 let's go here let's do it right and I'll just zoom it a little bit okay and I'll try to draw channel or trend line okay so here what I'll do is that I will let's say that you started this you had an option of investing in ppf ppf ppf and all that versus nifty 50 so you started the exercise from here right 2011 right so like I know so this is what a channel might look like okay so this is another channel okay now let's say that you put like you know you started investing you anyways will not invest in bulk but you started investing here okay when the nifty was roughly 6000 okay it fell it rose it fell it rose it fell it rose and it eventually went here okay 2015 and it went to 8.5 okay in four years you made how much two and a half over 6000 should you have sold some of it at least 50% here yes right as per technical you should have right so how much returns did you make you at least made like whatever like 45% returns okay over how many L basis 4% now what is like after tax return that you are booking it's at least like CGR basis pay I think it will at least be 10 11% right so the point is that it gives you the option of rotating capital even when you're buying the market really high okay and here there was a bad entry point right and also we assume that you're not downward averaging anything for example what do I mean by that is that for example if you go here right right now right now here the market has fallen here you're entry for example if you're buying the market here to begin with right now what do you think is likely going to be going to be the case yeah if you're looking at a 10 year basis okay so for example this is the yeah okay so for example this is the channel okay right then now the likely scenario might be that hey the channel might go like this okay it will go up you say a little bit go down this the RIKKA one is like so then we will trade this channel the point I'm trying to tell you is that see locking your money time is the most powerful asset okay on a five year you can do your career on five year basis you can shift countries on five year basis your kids if you miss the first five years of your kids life it's huge so time is the most important essence right on things okay now NPS EPF EPF makes you invest money for 10 15 years and it gives you no opportunity to rotate rotate capital at least nifty on a 10 year basis if you're taking such a long time it at least gives you an opportunity to rotate capital somewhere right now how effectively you do that that's a separate argument right which we'll learn subsequently on the course but the idea that I'm trying to share with you is that at least on nifty 50 if you understand even the basics of investing you will be able to rotate capital couple of times okay so if you're able to do that that makes very good return because when I'm saying that nifty 50 on an average gives well when a half percent return I assume that on a 20 year basis you bought something 20 year ago you kept on investing and never rotated capital but that's not the case all smart investors rotate capital now it's like you know Warren Buffett you do get the capital you rotate can you see I you should not try to time the market by idiots have picked up that nonsense somewhere from Mr. Warren Buffett right without even looking at what Mr. Warren Buffett himself is doing right now just simply go and search what Mr. Warren Buffett is doing okay so for example and in this case you can use a tool called as perplexity okay so just simply go Indian by loan even I right perplexity okay so you just simply go and type right how much cash is Warren Buffett sitting okay so he's sitting on 325 billion dollars in cash okay so together it's a 325 billion dollars in cash what is the portfolio size of Mr. Warren Buffett it's 600 billion dollars okay so he's sitting 50 percent cash you are like a sip you're like who is an idiot then right so if he's saying that don't time the market by himself is timing the market because goal of any investor is to have money to buy opportunities okay so I am like 30 percent invested in the US market I'm also sitting on 70 percent cash because I'm not like you know invested 100 percent but in Indian market I'm 95 percent invested okay so the point being that you know don't just simpl
