==================================================

SUMMARY:
The text discusses an investment strategy focused on active portfolio management, emphasizing trend analysis, profit booking, and a step-by-step approach to building a diversified portfolio. Key concepts include buying during downtrends, selling during uptrends, laddering investments (starting with index funds, then large caps, mid/small caps, hedging, and leveraged trades), and distinguishing between core (long-term holdings) and non-core (cyclical/turnaround trades) portfolios. The speaker advocates for fundamental and technical analysis, using examples like Google, cyclical stocks (e.g., Coal India), and consistent compounders (e.g., Hindustan Unilever, Nestle India) that follow patterns like the 200-day moving average.  

###

KEY TAKEAWAYS:
- **Trend-Based Investing**: Buy during downtrends or channel breakdowns; sell during uptrends.  
- **Profit Booking**: Partially book profits (e.g., 20–25%) in uptrends but avoid exiting entirely.  
- **Laddering Approach**: Gradual progression from index funds → large caps → mid/small caps → hedging → leveraged trades over 4–5 years.  
- **Core vs. Non-Core Portfolio**:  
  - *Core*: Long-term holdings (e.g., 70% finance stocks in India, 100% tech in the US).  
  - *Non-Core*: Opportunistic trades in cyclical/turnaround stocks (e.g., Coal India’s sine-wave patterns).  
- **Technical Tools**: Use 200-day moving average (200 DMA) for consistent compounders (e.g., buy HUL/Nestle below 200 DMA, sell when far above).  
- **Fundamental Filter**: Only invest in stocks passing fundamental checks (e.g., business health) before applying technical strategies.  
- **Patience & Discipline**: Avoid shortcuts; systematic investing requires time (e.g., 10 minutes daily analysis) and emotional resilience (holding through 15–20% dips).  
- **Alpha Generation**: Outperform the market by combining trend analysis (e.g., 58% alpha in a downtrend) with selective stock-picking.

ORIGINAL TEXT:
ere also. I'll buy here also. Then you will say, for example, you bought it in like 2024, here, I'll buy right here, I'll buy and all that stuff. So this becomes like my pivot point. So one could argue that, okay, this 40% 43% run up, I have made in how many years, in two years. Okay. Am I happy with it? Very, very happy. Right? If you were to actually follow me, you would have also made like 20% run up on this CAGR on this. Is this bad? Absolutely not. Why? Because the market has gone down 15%. What is your alpha? It's 58%. Okay. So the alpha is like crazy on this, right? Now here should you book profits? Yes. Why? Because this is an uptrend. This is touching this graph. Okay. Now, if it falls, I'll add more. How much profit? How much should I book profits here? Not everything, right? Maybe like 20% 25% go all that stuff. Okay. But the point is some profit booking should be done. And therefore, SIPs do not, like, you know, strike any chord with me, right? Because I could decry as I'm a chart, right? You are seeing it right in front of you. That okay, you know what? Okay. This is hitting the bottom. And but up as I be going to be there, right? Because date me right on that makes no sense to me. Okay. So this is like the simple bottom line on this, right? I hope this point is clear. Okay. So these are like basics of portfolio building. That's the last point. It is the concept of laddering. Okay. Ladering simply means that you will go through a journey of investing, right? The journey of investing means that see, first step, you will have to understand index. You will have to understand how to buy index. What is an uptrend that you do not buy on an uptrend? You basically sell on an uptrend. You buy on a down trend or a channel breakdown. Right? If you just simply do this on index, only it's fine. Not a problem. Okay. Second stage, you start adding large cap stocks. For example, Google, if you're a Google purpose, Google, okay. Third step, you start adding small and mid cap stocks. Fourth step, you start adding and here I mean, you have to cover international also. Okay. Fourth step is you start learning a little bit about hedging. Okay. Then you finally move to like leveraged investing. Okay. So these are four or five steps that you have to go through, but it will take you like I mean, for example, if you're starting here in 2025, you will be here. If you're diligently doing investing by 2030 or not before that, okay. So it will take you four or five years because you need to have made real profits here. Okay. For you to move to this stage. Okay. Now, leverage trades are extremely complicated. I mean, if you get that time someday, then I'll probably explain it, but you don't need to get there. You will move in a organized fashion only step by step. You cannot jump the steps. Okay. If you're never bought, got into the habit of selling on an uptrend, buying on a down trend, doing trend analysis, keeping 15, 20 things on a checklist. And it's not as if you have to invest like crazy amount of time doing all this, right? I mean, you'll get some commentary from me. You go and analyze it on your own. It will take you 10 minutes, like literally in a day to do this. Okay. If you are feeling, if we about some stocks, for example, I taught a motor, I have what it should I buy it or should I not buy it. What should you be doing? Well, you go, right? You look at data motors. Number one, you, what do you do? You go and do fundamental analysis. Okay. Business analysis, what I taught. Okay. Number two, what should you be doing? Right. So, uh, here, you have the clue. Right. So, for example, let's do data motors, right? And what does, okay? Okay. So, what should you be doing? Right. Now the stock has started to consolidate. Okay. And this is a down trend. Now, if you trust the stock, what is, is this like a time to sell or is this like a time to add? So, what is this? This is our down trend. Okay. If the stock is fundamentally good, what should you do? You should add not sell. Okay. But it has to pass the first filter, those 1718 points filter. If that is not passing, then you don't do all this. Okay. Then you don't play around with this stock. Okay. Uh, I got a technical trade for example, this is called as trend reversal. Okay. So, for example, if this trend is reversed, right? Then sometimes you will buy it here, then they take a little bit of run up exit. So, in sub-chakkar, we need to point out because we are not like traders. We are investors. Okay. Um, we will only enter into an asset if you have the ability to hold it 15, 20% down. For example, if you buy Google now, what do you think is going to happen on Google? Maybe it will correct by another 15, 20%, but will you, but then will you struggle too much if holding Google at like minus, uh, at minus 15? No, because now the thing is that now Google is minus 40% from the top. Which is awesome. Right. So, like, I mean, unless it's like completely getting demolished in the next three years, just max out your five percent five percent and stay put. Okay. So it's free money there. Okay. From that angle. Okay. So I hope that this point is clear to everyone. Right. Okay. Now, let me just quickly take you through all the remaining points. Okay. So these are like some, uh, positions. Okay. Core and non-core portfolio. Okay. So this is again an important concept. Core portfolio means that, hey, generally, I will buy these type of stocks. For example, we did that business analysis. Uh, India portfolio, for example, in my case, what I typically do is, and tomorrow, I'll show you my portfolio also, at least like my kuch kuch kuch, you know, the Khadungaapko. So India portfolio, what do I do? Right. Almost 70% of my portfolio is finance, right. Banks, EMCs, insurance, etc. I have like healthcare, like health stocks, maybe like 15, 20%, right. And then 10% will be some random stocks. Okay. Some limited small cap companies. That's it. Okay. US, it's 100% tech. Okay. I have zero overlap between my US portfolio and India portfolio. I don't have TCA, SIN, POSA, and all that stuff. I'd rather buy like Google at like 25, 30% discount. Okay. So this is my core portfolio. Now does it mean that if some opportunities coming in the market, uh, for swing trading or something of that sort, then I will not do it. No, I will do it. Right. But that will be non-core. Right. Now what is the meaning of non-core? Now for this, you need to understand the concept of turn around and cyclical stocks. Now if you go and study like, and I'm just using it as an example, I'm not doing any swing trades as of now, right, because the market itself is done. Right. So for example, if you consider like this, okay. So, in fact, our motto is not a good example. Let's say coal India. Okay. Okay. So here, what you can see is that this is basically a cyclical stock. Okay. So you can see that this was one cycle. Okay. Then this was another cycle. Okay. So it goes like it has the sine wave pattern. Okay. So now, and these are like some mini cycles. Right. So basically, what you do is that you understand the nature of the stock and trade it accordingly. Okay. So here, you have to be right. I mean, for example, if you're seeing that it will usually form like this type of a cup pattern. Right. So what do you do? Like you buy it in the aggregation zone. So this is aggregation zone, this part. Okay. So cup me, right. I mean, this is the cup. Right. So you buy it here at the bottom of the saucer. Okay. So you do this. Okay. This is like, you have to do it. Right. So I would do like this is a clear cup. So I'll buy it here. Okay. This is a clear cup. So I'll buy it here. Okay. Wherever I can make this saucer thing. Okay. So this is a clear cup. I'll buy it here. Okay. So I would rather buy like these because this is typically how the stock operates. Everyone is understanding. Okay. Will I do anything with this here? No, this is not like my core stock. I don't care. Okay. About this. Okay. If I get this cup type of a pattern only then I will buy it. Okay. For example, let me show you Hindustan Unilever. Okay. Now what is that typical pattern on Hindustan Unilever? If you go and if you analyze what you will see is that this black line is called as 200 day moving average line. Okay. Now 200 day average moving line moving average line means what? It indicates that the it indicates the last it indicates that this is the specific price on the last 200 day as per the last 200 day averages. So this is the last one you're trading price. Okay. What you will typically see is that if H.E.L falls below this 200 day moving average line here it fell. Okay. Here it fell. Here it fell. Here it fell. Here it fell. Here it is. Okay. You buy Hindustan Unilever stock anytime below its 200 day moving average line and you can then flip it and you see. Okay. So this is most likely to happen. Right. That it will go back up or whatever. Right. And whenever it moves way past its 200 moving average line you sell. So this is the nature of the stock. This is the nature of cyclical stocks. So in fact even Nestle may it should be similar. Right. So Nestle India. So here again if we go look at P ratio. It is 200 DMA. Okay. This should be here. Okay. So this is your 200 day moving average line again exactly same way. Okay. Here if you buy 200 day moving average line this is 200 DMA. This is broken down. This is again broken down again broken down again broken down again broken down again broken down. Okay. So you have never taken a loss on something like Nestle India. If you buy it below 200 day moving average line. So should you add H.E.L and Nestle India right now? Maybe I don't know like it depends on your portfolio. Right. And what game do you want to play? Okay. But it's not like I mean that does not make any sense. Okay. Now these are called as consistent compounders. Okay. So this here we understand 200 day moving average concept. Okay. Turn around stocks. Her
