==================================================

 Hi everyone, I hope you can see me here me if yes very quick comes up and then we'll start. Okay awesome alright. Okay so people are still joining in right so I'll just wait for like a few seconds right and then we will start. Okay alright. Okay guys so first and foremost thank you for you know giving me a valuable time. Money is like separate right but time is of limited quantity so giving your time over like four days that's that's the most critical commodity that you have decided to give me. So I'll try to respect that I'll try to add a lot of value and I'll try to teach in the best possible way I can right now people who have joined the course right and who do not know about my background. So I don't know like I'm enjoying the course to begin with but I'll just quickly explain you my background right so I used to work as a management consultant with BCG Dalberg which are top tier consulting firms. And I was in their financial inclusion practice right at Dalberg so my background is in finance. I cleared like two levels of CFA never wrote the third one right and now then I like you know sort of have built companies have sold one of my companies to buy Jews right so. Now I can reveal the name right so not a problem so yeah so my background is finance and entrepreneurship currently I run a hedge fund in Dubai right so that's where I recently moved last year right and I started setting up my business. So that has given me like a perspective of managing money as well right so that's about my background and not be labor too much and waste class is time right to request right one is that many of you might be. Attending these type of classes after I don't know 20 30 years so please try to keep your phones away if possible right and second is that please start the cameras right I'll not bore you right whatever I teach it will be practically driven it will be based on my strategies of investing my own money. Yeah so it's going to be highly practical so I'm an industry practitioner I'm not like someone who just says I don't know what I'm investing my money or and then I invest via some PM so I manage my own money significant wealth has been invested through me right so I'll share all those practical experiences with you okay so that's the agenda right and. Before we begin right so just couple of quick notes right so one is that who is this course useful for right and and what is the R.Y. of the course right so that's very important for you to understand right and the R.Y. depends on what stage of investing you are in. So for example if you are a completely new person in the stock market and if this course can help you buy your first stock by. First stock so that adds value will it add value immediately no but possibly like after one year right you will become better right so all of us will go through an investing journey right and this journey is continuous right so even I'm going through that investing journey. Despite investing a lot of money right so every day you improve as an investor and this course gives you like a good fundamental base to start investing money and start managing money on your own okay second key value add for a new person would be that you will at least have a sense of something called as investment. Theses now investment thesis simply means that okay you are buying something right and you don't know why you're buying and suddenly it corrects like 30% now some of you would panic some of you would not panic. People who do not panic have an investment thesis and they do not sell that stock or that asset unless that investment thesis changes okay so yeah so how to develop that this will be like second critical value add from my side okay third is that for example many of you. You might be investing 0% money in stock markets right now right 100% might be on real estate or you might be investing 0% money on direct stocks okay all money on mutual funds only okay some of you might be having 0% international equity holdings right so not investing any money outside India now if I can help you move this needle right so again I'm writing the word move this needle then I have done my job okay so this is for beginners okay. Now if you are someone who is at intermediate stage now then what part of the course will help you number one I will teach you something called as macro style of investing right macro style of investing what does that mean etc I will get later into the the sessions but the idea is that I tell you like broad level stuff right how to do top down analysis and bottom up analysis I'll teach you both type of analysis and then it will at least introduce you. So what macro style of investing is how to become a better macro investor that's one second is that you will get a sense of valuation of a company right so for example let's say right now HDFC bank is trading at 750 rupees now how to calculate the risk reward equation right on that so that's called as valuation exercise so I'll teach you a little bit of that right so that's important so at least I'll tell you my side of the story is rotating capital now this is extremely extremely important and this is what I do and I have been advocating for the last one one and a half two years that rotate capital do not simply do SIP rotate capital now people have started to say this okay so I have been quite vocal about this fact that SIP forever and dies strategy does not work so this is third okay now then comes the third type of investors these are like you know advanced okay and these are typically people who are invested like more than five six crore of their own money and with experience there is no substitute to experience okay so that's that's just what you need to go through in order to become like an advanced level investor it's not about how many years of experience you have it's about what percentage of your net worth you have put in the stock market okay so that's more important concept that I'll teach up sequently so for these guys right I mean you know how to tax structure properly right I'll at least introduce you to this idea. How much of your wealth should you diversify outside India so all these points all these are practical driven things that you need to understand now I'll say that okay I've paid like whatever like 20,000 to piece for this course etc can you help me save money so I'll help you save money on all three okay so like in the first five minutes of the course okay now here is an example I'm a tax resident of UA and I am investing money now if I invest money in the US market on short term basis long term basis for example I buy Google stock today and if I if it goes up by 5% I book profit so I bought it at $100 and I sold it at $105 I made $5 gain how much tax do I need to pay in the US or in UA anyone any cases zero okay so short term zero long term zero if I sell covered calls if I sell any kind of hedging strategy how much tax do I need to pay the answer is zero okay so let's go back and let me first and foremost I'll be make that 20,000 okay so in the 5 first 5 10 minutes of the course okay so if you look pushing you know what is the ROI of the course I'll just quickly tell you right for each of these three categories okay so for example here right if you are sitting on a 5CR plus portfolio okay what should you do you should move to a low tax economy okay where the capital gains is zero now how to do that we will understand subsequently but at least I'm introducing you to that idea because if imagine this right that if you are like I mean you might be 30 and you might be doing SIP or whatever for the next 30 years and let's say that you build like a 10.15.20.20 portfolio okay what will you right so that's not a big deal what was the capital gains tax and 2018 long term capital gains tax 2017 in India and you know zero okay what was the capital long term capital gains tax in 2022 or 2021 like so it was 10% okay now what is the capital gains today long term capital gains on equities 12.5 now the interesting question to ask is that you are 30 years old today it's 20 25 in 20 55 because you are SIP okay or you are mine and forever holding it in the Indian market can anyone tell me with guarantee what the LTCG on Indian equity market will be so if you are already the first key takeaway and I will always speak in key takeaway terms that the first key takeaway of the course even before starting is arbitrage okay this is an arbitrage arbitrage means China import story that you buy a holy pitch carry as a trader in India at 100 rupees and sell it in the market at 150 that's a pure arbitrage right so all cost inclusive and all that you're making like 50 rupees okay so the biggest arbitrage right now and investing is and this no one will tell you because they will get screwed right if someone starts telling all these things publicly and your CBI advisor will not tell you your you know mutual fund advisor will not tell you because what is there go there go is to keep money in India okay so this is a problematic thing because this information is also is not out there so the first key point that I'll tell you because I see a lot of experience people on the call that if you are already in that 3 4 5 CR ticket range and all your portfolio is stuck in India and your investing big ticket amounts what's the first key arbitrage that you've to explore this may 100% of the way so I'll say that right I mean at 100% you will say you money is go to a low tax low capital gains tax economy everyone with me okay this has got nothing to do with investing but at the same time it has got everything to do with investing because over time it can save you cross okay that's one okay number two point right what about like okay fine we don't have like this much big portfolio we invest like regularly right and we are just starting out of portfolio fair enough right so let's move to talking about point two right so interim stage right or intermediate stage or new stage okay now at new stage I will tell you my story so when I started investing right I was in a full time job at a demanding consulting firm so I did not have like you know time okay so my my mutual fund advisor right and I my mom said that he want to invest in like mutual fund right I would say if this that's up okay so I spoke with like a mutual fund agent right I mean he was a family friend he suggested me like these four five plants okay and I invested via something called as regular plans okay now for every mutual fund that is something called as regular and direct plans okay now regular plans are and we don't understand the difference right because we are starting out we don't know like you know what the regular direct there's that there are like you know four thousand mutual funds right that's planned this okay so if I'm okay fine I'll put it in like regular so now then over time I realize that if you put money in regular plans in mutual funds you will end up losing crazy amount of commissions okay and it's not as if that you're getting any additional advantage it's just that you're paying more commissions now then natural question comes that okay how much commissions am I paying maybe like 0.2% 0.3% 0.5% or I might if I'm having like a very good job I might give my money to PMS guys right and there I'm paying 2% of AUM so natural question comes for newbies is that how to invest if the only thing that you take away from the courses that how can I save my commissions okay saving commissions can actually save 30 40% of your portfolio okay now this is a mathematics that again no one will tell you okay so let's run through that mathematics and let me show it to you so that it gives you like a little bit of more sense okay so for example and this is like a computation that you can do on your own so for example if you're running an SIP of 25,000 to piece on monthly basis okay and let's say that you're 20 25 you will at least invest it like 45 so we can make this 40s okay now PMS guys for example Sauramukharji in the likes they take 2% of AUM okay and they are under performing the market right similarly mutual funds can charge somewhere between you know 0.3 to like 1 1 and a half percent also okay so let's say and I'm not picking and I'm making a general case so studies tell us that 85% of money managers beat PMS beat mutual fund guys they do not beat the benchmark now what is the meaning of benchmark benchmark means means that if you're considering nifty 50 now this is the collection of top 50 or top 50 large cap companies in India these would be ITCH, DFC, Bank all that stuff so the benchmark is nifty 50 for a large cap fund okay large cap but for a small cap fund for example there is something called as quant small cap fund right now you'll see that okay the CAGR is 25% for that quant small cap fund but is the benchmark nifty 50 there no because quant small cap small cap means that these are not nifty 50 or top 50 companies these are smaller companies okay so there the benchmark would be what the benchmark would be small cap 250 index okay so that is the relevant benchmark so if you compare the relevant benchmark let's say let's compare like large cap to large cap then mutual fund guys or PMS guys might only generate like 12% okay so nifty on an average generates like 12 and a half so let's look at the difference okay so let me just quickly I'm the mathematics and then we'll dive deeper into it and I'm just showing you the power of commissions okay how much it actually impacts your portfolio even small small numbers compounded over 40 years so if you're doing it 12% okay so you make 25 roughly 24.5 CR okay now all I'm changing is like 13% right so if you do it without commission so this is 32.5 so 24.5 minus 32.5 it's 8 crore on a base of 24.5 so that is one third so how much is the portfolio change it's 33% on a 1% commission difference okay so 33% this is the difference between traveling like economy class versus business class or business class versus first class okay consistently okay so people just think that it's like 1% commission or 0.5% commission or 0.1% commission commission is poison okay in in in this okay now this works at multiple levels okay so for example Indian banks are the most crooked banks out there right I don't know Africa or something but that might be different but honestly if you do FX right so for example if you're own taxed money you are trying to send it to Dubai right like our whichever country you want to move okay my voice is okay right just give me a second guys okay just a minute please don't start like any boards and all right so just a minute I'm just quickly checking if everyone is able to join the class okay okay my voice is clear no not a problem okay all right okay so I'm just checking if everyone is able to join I'm just message my team okay so for example Indian banks right the FX conversion for example if you do any conversion from let's say ADCV Abu Dhabi commercial bank in UAE and try to send money in India the FX rate remains the same whatever is Google showing you okay but if you do the opposite that you send money from HDFC to DRAM account right here it's they will charge you like 1% commission on that money also okay so it's like crazy anyways the idea is not to crib but to show you orbit charges okay so coming back to the chart that I had drawn right so you see I can bring back it got evaporated okay so if you are like a yeah so if you are number one like start starter or intermittent level so start may the arbitrage is that you simply move from regular funds to direct okay that's a very simple hack of saving a lot of money if you are intermediate right then the only thing two things that you can do one is that don't buy overvalued things and number two rotate capital if you can run these learn these two things rotate capital yeah you will make a lot of money okay number three if you are sitting on a portfolio of 3CR plus and if you move to a low capital gains gains tax country you will save crazy amount of money over time okay that's these are three points that are arbitrage oriented points this has got nothing to do with investing but add at the same time this has got to do a lot of things to do with investing okay these are points because what what ends up happening is that for example if you start investing in mutual fund then you get logged into it it becomes very difficult to take out money right even from a regular to direct because you will think that okay is the market right what if I miss the rally all that's right so I'll speak about how to move money also from one type of mutual fund to the next but I hope that these three points are clear to everyone right that where the arbitrage is very simple and this is the ROI of the course okay so I hope I was able to help you save money and give you a clarity on where the course is headed now just helping you understand the overall structure of the course right and this is what the course structure looks like what we are going to cover right so class one and two today we will study macro economics right this is part one right and let me just draw it for you first okay so basically like in investing there are three or four key parts okay the first key part is something called as personal finance okay now this is something that you might watch a lot of videos so I don't teach too much personal finance because this is personal in nature I can't teach you much but I can tell you some basics which I will tell along the way so there is no dedicated class on personal finance second part is that you understand something called as macro level analysis now here you need to know the basics of economics like what is interest rate what is liquidity what is quantitative easing quantitative tightening now if I give you homework that read like 50 lectures of 50 books you'll go mad right I mean those are like you know core macro economics and your head will spend so I'll try to explain this part in very easy to understand language otherwise this is a course in itself in India schools okay third part is called as fundamental analysis so you look at like company balance sheet you look at like p ratio p b ratio all that there are 100 different ratios now people try to become like accountants here okay that okay if we start learning about p ratio then we need to know about peg ratio also we need to know about p to b ratio also we need to look at like you know market cap to gdp ratio also so there is no end to all this okay so how to like you know be a broad broad person okay so this is the third layer of analysis fourth is called as technical analysis yes technical analysis for example we look at candlestick patterns right so for example if I have to quickly show you so here you will see red and green candles so how to analyze all this right is this a good time to enter right this asset called as an empty bank index so I'll teach you technical analysis okay and then finally like business analysis is another key concept so fundamental analysis business analysis industry analysis technical analysis and personal finance so these are like four five key topics and macro analysis so these five six topics are key topics that we will cover over the next four days okay cool so this is going to be a power packed course it might be a little bit fast-paced I cannot write I mean I'll teach fast only okay so hopefully it will add like a lot of value right so in case you guys miss the recordings will be up right in 24 to 36 hours so you can watch it during the week also okay and that's part one so once these four days are done you'll be added to the community on whatsapp right so where I will write detailed posts on whatever actions I am taking in terms of investing on everyday basis so you will have a very clear understanding of and you'll get to see things in action okay that okay why am I buying what is position sizing right how I mean why am I buying like small small amounts right so yeah so these are like basic broad topics if you just want to quickly glance through it what I'll be I'll not be teaching like fnno and all that because that is like a topic in itself it takes a lot of time to teach so you know I mean that can't be done but these are like you know you guys can scroll it at your own time right so this is these are some things that I will teach right and don't be like so like today's topic just keep a note right so these are specific points that I'll be teaching okay okay so let's begin right and I would want you guys to answer like three questions first these are very important questions we work from morning to evening right and we don't have a clue how much money we want to make right so and I can show it to you okay so if I ask you a very simple question how much money you need to retire what will be your answer just or where you know and what does this depend on then I'll tell you okay 50 euros so we have range coming up okay so this is always an interesting question to ask five euros to 50 euros 70 euros we have range right so five euros 20 euros okay so okay so you get to the point right so I mean same question being thrown at people with discretionary income and we get the range from five crore to 70 crores and you're running like a headless chicken from morning to evening with no clue how much money you need okay so what does it exactly depend on it depends on inflation so someone is saying someone is saying current earning times inflation rate you will come up with really sophisticated formula okay now the first thing that I tell people is that hey if you want to retire you the first critical question you need to ask is that where you want to retire right there is a huge difference in terms of retiring in Dubai versus retiring in Sharja okay there is a huge difference between retiring in Sharja versus retiring in Ajman there is huge difference between retiring in Mumbai versus retiring in let's say our tier two city like Nagpur okay there is at least a 30 40 percent difference in corpus itself right so yeah go right so I mean it's relatively low cost it again depends on do you have your own housing or not okay so that's another critical aspect of it right so this is where understanding of personal finance comes into the mix okay so my general advice to people who have a network of more than like three CR two more than like two CRs that peace owner house okay or peace owner realist it it need not necessarily be a house or whatever but at least own some land some hard asset right why because it controls your cost of living okay so that's like question number one right now let me try to answer this question because there is no end to this debate and it really boils down to a few things okay so number one point that it boils down to how much money you need to retire very simple exercise number one step is that you need a big portfolio I would put this as in today's term right so for example three CR at least okay step two is the rate at which you can grow this portfolio sustainably what is the meaning of sustainable I'll explain that in a minute right I'll highlight this word in green okay now for example right I mean what is a good growth rate for this three CR portfolio right I would say that it should at least grow between 12 to 15 percent why because inflation is at least 10 percent for our segment I was again one of the early people to say this like three four years ago that inflation for us is not five six percent inflation for us is 10 11 percent at least okay so you should grow at least faster than inflation okay and third is the amount of money that you're withdrawing from this corpus and can it sustain your current lifestyle now what is the meaning of that right so for example let's say that you grow your portfolio at 16 and your inflation is 12 now what is the difference it's 4 percent okay now this 4 percent is the withdrawable amount from this okay so for example four times three crores it's 12 lakhs this is your withdrawal corpus every year everyone gets how I got this right so it's very simple 16 percent is the rate at which you're growing this corpus of three crores 12 percent is your inflation right 4 percent becomes your withdrawal withdrawable corpus this should at least be 4 percent okay so this this delta right whatever it is okay now you can play around with these figures for example some locations have lower inflation for example if you're living in a city in India or metro city in India the inflation will be higher but if you're living in a tier 2 city in India the inflation will be lower okay so you have to play around with this mathematics and get to at least 4 percent withdrawable corpus okay and then ask the question that hey boss can I survive with like 12 lakh rupees on early basis with this corpus now for some of you the answer will be no by you know we want to party every day right some of you say I'm with you're at the word of an onion so now that I cannot solve for you okay so you have to figure out whether this 12 lakh actually sustains your current lifestyle okay if this 12 lakh doesn't sustain your lifestyle then you increase the initial corpus it could be 5 crores 10 crores whatever it is right and withdraw 4 percent from it now the problem what do you think is the most difficult part in this entire equation the most difficult part is this right growing your capital at 12 to 15 percent sustainably now why is this difficult because this requires a system right it's very similar to you getting motivated on 1st January every month going to the gym working out for 3 hours and by 10th of January you are dead okay so you do not go to gym even once right after 10th of January guess how many you will do this a lot of things okay so the point is that hey can you sustainably do things for the entire year that's where the magic happens it doesn't happen that you're worked out for like 10 hours on like 1st January you know and give the shit okay so that's the point okay same happens with investing investing people make it exciting right investing is not exciting it's a very boring exercise you have to be like patient and all that stuff the point being that there are two types of investors one who do it for the thrill and second who do it as a system right so this course hopefully will help you become a more systematic investor right it will allow you to develop patients right so those are the qualities that I'll try to outline but just quickly explaining you the example right so for example I was speaking with like an architect friend of mine right and he must be he must have a network of like you know 4050 crores okay so he was talking to me that actually you know what tell me like three stocks I can buy in like today's market market correction has happened I just didn't really discuss right then he was thinking what was I last year I purchased like this particular small cap micro cap company right and I made like 100x return on it I said how much did you invest he said like I invested 5000 please okay so like you're at 40 crore 50 crore guy you invested 4000 and made like 100x my concern at worth by addition earlier right so it doesn't matter it's much better to invest like something like you know make like in terms of growing your capital sustainably you have to understand the concept of network and this is the second key takeaway that I will tell you okay so here we need to just quickly come right and do it via simple exercise see option one let's say and your network is what right you add all the assets that you have for example you have a house you have a stock market portfolio you have a mutual fund portfolio you have some gold you add all that and let's say it comes out to be one crore okay now right now for example market is down nifty 50 is down 14% from its peak some stocks like CDSL in Jill one are down 35% from its peak okay and nifty 50 is down how much 14% from its peak okay now let's say that you got like some inheritance okay and you have like you know you got like 50 lakhs of inheritance okay you're sitting in the market right now where will you have more confidence to invest this entire capital here or here option one or option two if you have to do a lump sum okay or you can split or whatever it is okay the point being that most of you will have the confidence to do it on nifty 50 okay because you inherently know that hey that's a more sustainable way of growing your money rather than putting bulk on on mid and small cap companies or companies which are very you know sort of complicated so this understanding this equation right and figuring out a sustainable way of splitting your money between option one and two or doing only option one or doing only option two it's a personal priority it's a personal thing right which I can't comment on but whatever system you come up with you should be able to consistently follow that system for example there is another system which is called as VC investing system for example I have a lot of friends who are VCs and they don't invest in stock markets at all okay their viewpoint is very simple let's see out of 100 companies that will you know if you invest in one or two will become unicorn and that will give us more than like 100% gain right and on our entire portfolio and 90% companies will die okay which is completely okay with them that's another sustainable way for them to invest so you have to figure out as an investor what your comfort level lies okay so I'll explain you my system right over time right I mean as we progress through the course but I hope that you got the concept of net worth and the concept of sustainable investing in the key takeaway is that this sustainable investing method is designed as per you this is not designed as per me I'm holding on our sector system is this you also copy that no that's not the point the point is that you learn from me and then you given your risk profile given your understanding what you want from life etc etc you mitigate or you don't make broad mistakes you maximize on opportunities and create a system that you are happy with every one with me so far cool awesome so these are like some basics of personal finance that I will tell you right and now let's deep dive into the course right and the first session that we are going to complete today is around so before I will be doing a little bit of discussion I've already done on this right how can you grow your wealth sustainably that if you develop a system okay it's not about like you know figuring out like one year you made like 1000% returns and then you did not invest like you know for five years and the net worth on which you made that 1000% return was only 0.5% of your boat for your big small sense okay uh third key question is that what if you attack 30% LTCG by the time you retire now do you have a plan okay this is a genuine concern which no one which no one is telling you to think about but I would highly encourage you to think about because even if like I mean for example you put like let's say one crore in the market right now it grows to like 40 crores and at the end of that this hypothetically you have to pay like 50% LTCG you know it makes no sense so therefore figuring out this third equation is also very important as and when you're portfolio grows okay now many of you would jump to conclusion that should we stop investing in India the short answer is no okay you should invest in India because there is a way to structure this as long as you're not booking capital gains okay so for example technically you can invest in India right now okay or like in US right right now like at least US much a legais system right and then you like let's say that you're investing from 20 years to 50 years okay and you're not booking any profits per se because here if you book profits as an Indian tax resident you will have to pay taxes in India which again is subjected to 12.5% LTCG and it's 20% or 12.5 I'll double check okay for international investing but if for example if you're investing between 20 to 50 years and you have a big portfolio then technically right as per today's rule you can become like a UAE tax resident or whichever country that taxes or Singapore tax resident and then you can book profits and bring that money to UAE right and then there you don't have to pay any LTCs okay so this is like a rule okay so maybe I'll explain it if we get the time subsequently okay so the macro concepts so this is the macro class and we will study like 67 concepts right which I'll take you through and the first key concept that we will study is something called as asset class diversification this is a very important concept right very simple but very important right and basically what it says is without boring you with too much details that for example if you're doing fixed deposits now here the risk is low and the return is also low okay for example if you're putting your FD money or like if you're doing like a 1 crore FD on HDFC bank you will make 7% but is this the return that you're making no because you have to look at after tax returns so how much you are paying as tax let's assume that you're on the highest tax so you'll pay 30% okay so you are effectively making like 5% after tax now what is inflation in India for you it will at least be like 89% so how much money are you losing here so you are effectively losing minus 3% now as a system if you put money in an FD you are 100% going to lose money now you'll say as I have told you I have been in influencers and this that stuff okay and is there like no utility to FD money there is utility to FD money do I do FD yes okay but there is a specific reason why I do FD money that is called as experimentation money now what is the meaning of experimentation money so for example if I have high risk job for example I'm an entrepreneur there is no guarantee that I will make money next year or the year after that or the year after that so how much money should I lock away safely without thinking about it even as investment capital really depends but I would figure out like my iterative cycle now what is the meaning of iteration cycle for example let's say that you run a small business okay your textile business you have like you know trading business or whatever it is then usually you will say that you know what boss if my business goes to zero it will take me like 3 years to build another business okay now for 3 years I don't need any headache so what should I do I should put 3 years of my expenses into a FD okay where to put it how to put it there you're not looking for growth okay yeah with G1 small finance you have to be by month grow right just do it in HDFC only it's fine right that's not the money that you're looking to grow that's your iterative cycle or experimentation cycle capital that's the utility now if you're a government job percent for example my wife was an IES officer Indian Economic Service Officer for her to lose her job right it has to go by the president of India okay so it's not as if that someone can fire her okay so for example I have you have you have a high court judge case but I will give you right now and he made like I don't know income account you're right and then 16 crore of like in a cash was I you know what discovered in his house right and now then he was like in some I don't know it's with sit which high court he was in then he was transferred to some other high court right so that was the maximum punishment right so the point is that some jobs are extremely safe okay now do you need like 3 years of capital like me right or do you do you need like 3 years of iterative capital probably know maybe you require like 3 months of that capital right everyone understand right this concept okay natural question comes at Akshath where are you doing it right see I'm now doing it in UAE because for me the if there is no loss of capital there right so for example in UAE I can do FDs at like 4.75 percent there is zero the inflation in and after tax I get 4.75 because the because the capital gains is zero okay so my after tax UAE FD returns as 4.75 and inflation in UAE is 2 percent okay so net effectively even after doing FD I can make 2.75 percent total everyone understood right so it really depends on your personal situation some of you might be in the US some of you might be in UK now again there the tax might be very high all that stuff so hard to say that all that right but if you have no other option at least just think about this entire thing from a iterative cycle capital right where are you creating FDs in UA so you do it in my bio bank right or like ADCB wherever like or there is like fab does like good rates so they are also okay so first Abu Dhabi bank so all these are good okay so you can do that right everyone with me what is the role of FDs right so this is the first asset class and here I will call it as iterative capital right this is very important then comes the second right because all of us want to grow our money right so for example if you look at large caps and India on Nifty 50 will you tag it safer or more risky compared to S&T 500 which is a US index where will you put it I'll probably put it like here okay so like almost at the same level that the return profile is also similar and risk profile is also similar what about like small caps right so small caps I'll put it here because the risk is higher right and returns are also higher now just for context Nifty 50 on an average right on a 20 year CGR basis gives around 12.5% now small caps gives around 21% right on a 20 year basis okay now to contextualize this better right please understand a rule of 72 now 72 means that how much time does it take or how many years does it take for your money to get doubled okay so take the number 72 divided by the number of return okay so this is 12.5 okay and this is what this is almost six years okay so yeah almost six years five point something years okay so roughly it takes six years to double your money in Nifty 50 right how many years does it take to double your money on an average on small caps so you divide this by 21 so this becomes what three point something years to double your money in small cap and mid caps okay so this is a difference between this and this now as retail investors we get very excited about this equation that okay if I am getting to double my money like literally half the time compared to large caps I will primarily be a small cap investor investing is about and this is the third key takeaway for the class and you only need to know town take a ways investing is about opportunity and you will only understand this if you buy realistic okay so like because that's the easiest thing to understand right now what is the meaning of opportunity for example in Bangalore this opportunity is going to come in the next two three years right a lot of people like IT workers etc like normal job doers because both husband and wife have a job they will go and take an EMI on a two-carrow house yeah which they can't like afford right now one of them might lose a job now what do you think they will do they will sell that house now that that thing is called as distressed selling right now they might even sell it below the market trade right now should you go and buy that you'll say you know I'm not going to do that I'll take someone's you know I'll seek someone's trouble as opportunities but that is what unfortunately investing is I cannot change the rules of the game people make money by investing in cigarette companies that kills people right that's how it is right and I cannot change the rules of the game for you the point being that as an investor you have to buy opportunities that's it okay so this happens in real estate very easy to understand that there might in your society someone might be doing a distressed sale should you buy it yes for example this house where I'm currently in so I bought it in Goa this is my house right I mean this is the first house I have bought ever in my life that I'm going to live not going to rent not going to year be nothing and I'm going to be a buraza lagara because I'm getting the entire innovation done so so the point being that I bought this right and here like I'm special situations come okay so for example in this society no one sells because half of the society people are like you know and arise they don't even live they don't even do Airbnb how the society is ghost town and they don't want to do anything with their property and they don't even sell why because they all are like those are the rules right so they don't need to sell like anything okay so here the deal was that hey I want like this money entire money invite by tomorrow okay so like if you have capital you get to buy cheap okay so that's a simple point okay now something similar is going to happen in Dubai okay so I'm telling you already right so something similar is going to happen in Bangalore okay so all these things are going to happen right it's just that you have to take advantage of these opportunities has an investor now these opportunities also come in the stock market but in stock market this is more difficult to digest what do why do I say it because it's like this right having for example you own a house and then then you know someone like and this is an example that was given by Warren Buffett and Elon Musk that if someone stands in front of your house right every day eight in the morning and start yelling your house price then you'll get to know and you will start thinking about yeah you're the needs to like it basically not you're right and all that stuff you'll be stressed about it but do you even know what your house is worth today half of you would not even have a clue okay in my society for example people do not have a clue what the house is worth they are living in like Australia or wherever Japan and all that stuff and they are clueless what the house price here actually is okay it's very hard to figure out housing prices in India right so everyone with me right that okay like you know you need to understand as an investor our key objective is very simple that we take advantage of opportunities and to now comes a very natural question that how do you take advantage of opportunities you can only take advantage of your opportunities if you have a range of assets that you can potentially buy for example if you know about real estate and if there is a distressed deal and you can analyze that deal you can buy it okay but if you know nothing about Bangkok real estate even if a distress sale is going in Bangkok real estate hypothetically some sections will you be able to buy it you'll say you know I'll start learning about Bangkok real estate when the distress happens but by that time you learn and you execute it's already done okay so those deals are gone what about Dubai real estate same thing what about goa real estate same thing what about Bombay real estate same thing what about Bangalore real estate same things what about like large caps now here it's easier to do okay so for example because everyone each of us can track nifty 50 it's given to us right every day you'll read a headline right in the newspaper oh you know 10,000 crore of wealth of investors got wiped out from the market you'll say oh brother you're right so because there is someone sitting on your head and yelling the prices of stocks each day okay so so that's the point the more arrows you have in your arsenal that you know about different different types of real estate stock market different types U.S. stock market Indian stock market European stock market you know about FNO etc I was against FNO okay but over time I have warmed up to the idea that see the more you know the better it is I'm not trying to get you guys into FNO okay please don't do it you don't need to start there okay but the point is that you'll go through this journey and this is called as laddering that first you understand like you know you start with every investment then mutual funds then large caps then small caps mid caps hedging all that so you'll go through this journey and the more ahead you are in this journey the better you will be able to see opportunities that's a very logical thing that I'm telling you now this does not mean that you remain dumb as a beginner or an intermediate guy okay and if you understand this risk reward curve you will not be dumb yeah for example here is FD right here is S&P 500 here is Nifty 50 here is large cap small caps sorry small cap mid caps then you have thrifted you have gold on this curve now see this is like very easy for us to understand this is what finance professors also tell you okay but what they don't tell you is that every asset class every asset type and serves a very different purpose okay so this is an Excel spreadsheet that I will create with you right and if you understand this this is your fifth key takeaway right and if you understand this Excel spreadsheet it will add a lot of value to your life okay so let me just put it up okay so and I'll share this Excel spreadsheet with with all of you right so okay so for example this is now every asset class serves a different purpose and according to me every asset class has to serve at least one of these six purposes okay now or there will be more right I mean you can fill more blanks right I mean how it goes right so let me just help you understand for example if you if you invest in let's say real states so real states start now can real estate grow yes okay now you'll say that no RBI data does not tell us by Zav Iqbal Zathor right I mean would RBI include black money into real estate no right now if RBI selling saying to 23% growth that does not mean that to give a state has only grown at 23% someone in India it's very common real estate deals in black money and all that so it can't be accounted but from your own investigation you will whichever city you live in whichever location you live in you will clearly understand that she was real estate grows it's not as if that it does not grow do people lose money in real estate yes do people lose money in stocks yes but if you're buying high quality real estate high quality stocks then the chances of losses very less right so that's we can agree now what is the meaning of growth when I write growth expectation here it means that it can at least grow faster than inflation so does real estate grow faster than inflation good quality real estate yes why there is a structure behind it okay so if you go back and study economics now there is something called as factors of production now factors of production means that for example land labor capital and enterprise right either at a land okay these are factors of production now how is GDP created GDP is the sum total of all the goods and services that is produced within the economy right now how do you produce goods or services you require one of these four things you either require land you require capital labor or enterprise enterprise means that someone has to like you know create an enterprise and you know beyond the prognorial all that stuff land is called as a factor of production now this is the concept of underlying versus derivative okay so for example if there is a mango okay so let me tell you this right so for example mango fruity right now mango fruity prize in 2020 five is let's say 10 rupees okay by 2026 it goes to 15 rupees now this is a derivative product right because mango fruity is made from mango okay or like one could argue let's assume that it's made purely from mango yeah so it's made of sugar but let's assume mango okay now can you imagine that okay that derivative prize is going up by 50 percent but the mango prizes are not going up by 50 percent it won't happen okay similarly for example very simple point right that for example if you have to crude right so crude oil for example if crude becomes expensive now India's import will will also go up because the underlying is crude and India imports very high amount of crude okay so that's the concept of underlying and derivative now something similar happens here that you know it's nonsense to think that real estate will not grow right land will always grow in value okay at least it will match inflation because all this reflects all these four things right if for example why do you think labor in Europe is very high or very is very costly because the per capita GDP of of Europe is high right so in order to like pay them minimum wage the labor is expensive right so that's the bottom line right there scarcity multiple other things are there but this is a concept of underlying and derivative so again like I mean without going into like you know complicated things here I just wanted to quickly help you understand this right so if you look at real estate would it grow the short answer is yes it will grow yeah so what about liquidity liquidity means that can you sell it off very quickly so the short answer is no what about volatility volatility means that for example ss is not right so for example one day the price is 100 rupees then x is like 50 rupees then after that it's 150 rupees so here this is a no okay what about cash flow can you make regular income from real estate yes with a very high degree of uns very high degree of certainty for example even if you have a flat come together but you will get regular cash flow now how is this how does this feature in because I get a lot of questions from people who are hitting that retirement age of people ask me that he actually my parents want to retire and they need regular income what should they do can we do it in the stock market no you can't do it in the stock market you'll say dividends now dividends are horribly tax inefficient because dividends are taxed twice right how twice one in the hand of the company for example how do companies give dividends right so for example if you go here right and go on screener right so for example here and if you take a look at ITC then ITC is very dividend that is very dividend that is okay now where do dividends come from now dividends come from these profits okay so for example if ITC is in the year 2024 has generated 20,751 crores what it will do is 20,751 crores what what options does it have number one option is that it reinvests these profits okay that they go and build like 20 other factories 1000 crores or option two is that they redistribute this profit okay now when they redistribute this profit this is given to stockholders so for example if you own one stock of ITC and there are only 100 stocks of ITC that are there then you get a dibs on like you know divide this by 100 and this is the amount of dividend that you could get if the company is redistributing it but before this redistribution happens the company is taxed by whom by the government okay so this is one and when you get the dividend you are taxed again on the dividend at slab okay so you are taxed twice so buying stocks for dividend is stupidity at scale okay so never buy stocks for dividend it makes no sense then you'll say that okay if the company is not ready because see if ITC were to just redeploy that capital and create 20 new factories it will reflect into the stock price okay so the stock price itself will go up it's not as if that that money is like you know gone somewhere in thin air okay everyone understands we'll study this subsequently but the point is that there are certain things for example but the point is that there are certain things for example from a tax efficiency perspective if you consider dividends on this this is useless okay in India at least okay now in some countries dividend is not taxed for example in UA dividend is not taxed so there it might make sense to plan your portfolio through stocks for dividends in Singapore dividends are capital gains is not there I don't think even dividends are there so no such problem occurs there okay so I hope this point is clear to everyone okay what about real estate can it protect your wealth which means so which brings us to a very fascinating story right of grandfathers okay for example right you know Gurpreet's grandfather right was smart right and he had like 10 grams of gold and he logged it in his locker okay in 1900s okay or something right and back then you can buy like with 10 grams of gold one cow okay now Gurpreet discovered it in 2025 that my grandfather left like 10 grams of gold can he still buy that one cow with that 10 gram of gold so what answer is he can okay because the gold price went up like crazy since 1900 to now my grandfather like let's say hypothetically right he had 10 grams of gold he decided that you know what I don't want that I'll get like 10 to pee of 15 to pee or 20 to pee note okay so you got like 20 to pee note he left it for me I discovered it in 2025 okay what can I do it 20 to pee I can't even possibly buy dairy milk with it okay so that's called it's wealth demolition okay so Gurpreet's grandfather protected his wealth okay so some assets protect wealth and some asset classes destroy wealth okay and this has to do with the buying power now I'll say he may have a part of the book pass right so you it impacts you a lot why because you are you have almost close to or almost 90 percent of you would have 100 percent exposure to iron r okay now just to scare you a little bit right if you just simply go okay okay so if we go right and if we just quickly check here right uh usd to iron r chart now back in 2014 I went to Singapore in Seattle okay so back then iron r was 60 rupees right now it is at 86 rupees now do you think that in Seattle is brought down their fees no they used to charge like whatever like 100,000 USD back then now how much are they charging now 120,000 right buddy you you you you and on top of that how much iron r depreciation has happened to me so 60 by 26 so 26 by 60 is like almost what 45 percent right so 45 percent additional fees I have to pay for in Seattle now I'll say that hey you know what I don't want to send my kids so number one most of you look young so you don't even know like you know where your kids would want to go right but they will definitely blame you if you are unable to send them right so like you know it kind of makes sense for you to worry about this from now okay that's fun uh second key thing is that's even if you are living in India it impacts you how exactly on per square foot basis Mumbai real estate is more expensive than Dubai real estate I'm not talking about Charger real estate as one real estate this that stuff I am talking about prime business-based property you can buy cheaper in Dubai right now then buying it in okay and it will give you like net cash flow better than Mumbai okay so that's one right I don't like where people are buying like you know properties in Mumbai now why is that happening right and what sends it to their make that's a very interesting like topic of discussion which we can talk for like one hour but I'll not waste so much time right but see what is happening yes that in India high ticket properties are mostly being bought by people who save in foreign currencies right so for example I right now I am technically now saving in dirhams okay now for me right I mean when I moved to UA and back then one dirhams was 22.5 now it is at 24 so one and a half times almost four five so that is almost six seven percent appreciation on dirhams so for me to buy so buy a property now in Mumbai has become 10% cheaper did you guys understand how okay because I'm saving in dirhams right now similarly if you're in if you're working with Google Microsoft in the US you are saving in US dollars okay again it has become cheaper for you 10% right but for a person living in India in Mumbai who has the aspiration of buying the same house has property become more expensive for you or cheaper for you it has become more expensive for you because your competition is someone else okay for that same house for example if 10% fall has happened in I and R mirita buddy I know right I mean I'll buy like now you know I'll just simply convert that dirhams by it here right so that's that's an option for me so even if you feel that you know what boss I am setting in India this I and R fold does not matter to me it does matter to you a lot okay why because the race of asset acquisition is a global race NRI is by crazy properties in India right almost come to go right almost 78% new properties that are getting sold are being bought by NRIs or daily Mumbai black money eyes okay that's all what is happening right so almost 78% properties okay and what ends up happening is that many of the goons actually live in Portugal or are like not sending their kids abroad they require a lot of money in white so NRI has become the number one category who are buying property in India because the seller property in goa because the seller wants money in white and only NRIs have white money right so just for example just you pocket right I mean you could not buy a property in like goa despite having 16 crores of wealth why because I want money in like one crore white give me one crore white right so now you cannot give it okay so that's the problem okay so I hope that this point is clear and you got the concept of wealth protection okay now quickly completing this entire exercise see here you need to think about it at multiple levels for example if you go to go to the equation around LT CG now is stock tax efficient from an efficiency basis yes it is okay so this is not like problematic right now what about wealth protection on real estate does it protect wealth good quality real estate protects us yeah so this is there right and what about tax efficiency on real estate now people who know how to deal with real estate will say yes people who do not have any understanding of it will say no it's worst okay and I can tell you 10 different ways of saving like taxes on real estate I'm like half a CNO okay so like like so what's simple here so see in India what ends up happening is that if you are commanding rent you will have to pay a slab almost because it becomes your operating income so in India personal income tax is very high so for example if you buy a flat and you have put it up on rent and you're collecting hypothetically all money and white you have to pay highest degree of tax that you are exposed to everyone with me on the flip side let's say someone like me who owns like let's say 10 properties what will I do I'll create a real estate management company now that becomes corporate income now in India corporate income is lower than personal income okay am I doing some pop no that's what tax tells me I'm learned about it I'm like you know exploiting that loophole right so it's not as if that I'm doing some pop right so for example hf right so for example hf many of us can't register so register it no it was a big deal right so these are all like legal ways of saving taxes so real estate can be a high tax game or a low tax game depending on how you're optimizing it so this is this really depends on your personal planning right so to say okay so this is what I would say now what about cryptos right so if you have to just quickly fill it now can stocks grow your well that more than like 12% because we are assuming baseline inflation for us at at this yes liquidity absolutely yes if you want money tomorrow you can get money tomorrow or the after okay volatility yes I okay so this is a negative part so I'll just highlight this in the red yeah so this is yes okay liquidity we want right so you'll highlight this in green right growth we want so you'll highlight this in green okay what about cash flow can you make cash flow from stocks absolutely not okay so you cannot say that next month I'll be able to book like one lakh rupees from my by running SWP you are idiot right if you're thinking that SWP will run forever okay why because you don't know where to the market is if the market in one month is corrected by 15 20% will you do SWP from it okay it does not make any sense right why would you withdraw from it okay so this is a red okay wealth protection on stocks maybe okay I don't know like so for example this is not a hard asset right I mean or the hardness of the asset is debatable okay so it's like maybe so we'll just put this in blue okay now what about another let's put another bucket which is called as pf epf ppf right so this is a very touchy topic a lot of people will get angry at me but let me just try to do my best okay so okay so color change okay so okay growth how much growth will you put it as a growth asset no why because despite investing your money for 20 years 15 years 20 years it does not grow your wealth after tax basis by more than 9% agree everywhere okay because pf epf ppf does not give you more than 8 to 9% returns on a long term basis okay after tax so this gets eliminated so here we can put a cross because we are already adjusting for taxes in terms of returns okay what about liquidity is it very easy to withdraw money from epf epf if you require money tomorrow will you get it no okay it will take some months I don't know right volatile not really right so this is like a green signal right we'll put green here okay what about cash flow absolutely not okay what about wealth protection absolutely not okay so one of the worst assets to invest is pretty much vf epf ppf as a system now the moment I said I'll be yeah people will get you know people will get mad at me right but if you have a debate with me I'm happy to answer every single question that you have on this why for example is FD better or is yeah is FD better or is pf epf ppf better I would say FD because it at least gives you liquidity right for example if you require that you know whatever like two three quick money if you for example FD money where can you use okay okay passive and what is it right so for example right let's see okay so if you go right this is bank nifty okay this is a trading channel now what do you think traders will be doing so this is a trading channel that has started from 2020 on bank nifty right and it is one of the most undervalued asset okay now if you don't have requirement of your FD money for the next two years what you can potentially do what some people will potentially do I'm not asking you to do it because I'm not a CB registered advisor all that stuff I'm just generally telling you what an trader will do yeah they'll buy it here right so we are already here right so you can see this red line this was a breaking of a channel and if you just swing it right so this is called a swing trade you made how much capital you made 17% capital okay on this now you say it has a zeroi it's not going to be a little bit of a deal see I mean you know it's math it's probabilistic game investing is probability oriented now there is no personal animosity that bank nifty bank index has with you okay it has been trading in this channel for a while right since 2020 so why are you assuming that it will not go up are the chances of going up high is this more likely scenario or it down is this more likely scenario right if you are betting here then there is a 16% 17% gain to be made okay so if you invest like whatever like you know two lacropy here your code fees was ruled right and hopefully right and you are done yes or ROI okay so can you put your FD money if you don't require it for two for let's say two years yes you pot potentially can okay everyone with me right how to do this analysis decide PQ separately right on subsequent classes but what I'm trying to tell you is that when it comes to FDs right even every money right you're safe money can sometimes be used for these type of opportunities everyone okay so guys please don't try it excessively okay I'll take like maybe one question on this and then we'll take out five minute break because some of you might be you know sort of getting a little bit tired okay so we'll take a coffee right now Bharatwaj yes you have a question yeah nope you have to unmute yourself I can't hear you guys I'll take the uns questions over the end I don't matter any questions so the other last why no why wealth protection is no in ppf because what is the return after tax return on ppf 8 9% maximum 9 m allo 9 mini right let's assume 9 okay now what is the like and that's after tax okay now what is the after tax return on nifty 50 12 and that's 12 and a half 13% you will make okay and then tax you'll pay 12.5 so roughly 10 and a half percent you will make right so that's a one and a half percent difference on what basis on 10 12 15 year basis because NPS ppf also you have to log for 10 15 years and nifty also we are assuming that 10 15 years but there's a good thing about nifty okay now what is the good thing about nifty so let's say that and I'm just randomly picking nifty 50 okay and this is capital rotation okay so for example here is nifty 50 okay now let's say like pick any 10 year window you just you guys name it whatever window you want okay let's pick another random right so 2011 pick up okay 10 year window so 2011 say 2021 one-way window okay so this is 2011 let's go here let's do it right and I'll just zoom it a little bit okay and I'll try to draw channel or trend line okay so here what I'll do is that I will let's say that you started this you had an option of investing in ppf ppf ppf and all that versus nifty 50 so you started the exercise from here right 2011 right so like I know so this is what a channel might look like okay so this is another channel okay now let's say that you put like you know you started investing you anyways will not invest in bulk but you started investing here okay when the nifty was roughly 6000 okay it fell it rose it fell it rose it fell it rose and it eventually went here okay 2015 and it went to 8.5 okay in four years you made how much two and a half over 6000 should you have sold some of it at least 50% here yes right as per technical you should have right so how much returns did you make you at least made like whatever like 45% returns okay over how many L basis 4% now what is like after tax return that you are booking it's at least like CGR basis pay I think it will at least be 10 11% right so the point is that it gives you the option of rotating capital even when you're buying the market really high okay and here there was a bad entry point right and also we assume that you're not downward averaging anything for example what do I mean by that is that for example if you go here right right now right now here the market has fallen here you're entry for example if you're buying the market here to begin with right now what do you think is likely going to be going to be the case yeah if you're looking at a 10 year basis okay so for example this is the yeah okay so for example this is the channel okay right then now the likely scenario might be that hey the channel might go like this okay it will go up you say a little bit go down this the RIKKA one is like so then we will trade this channel the point I'm trying to tell you is that see locking your money time is the most powerful asset okay on a five year you can do your career on five year basis you can shift countries on five year basis your kids if you miss the first five years of your kids life it's huge so time is the most important essence right on things okay now NPS EPF EPF makes you invest money for 10 15 years and it gives you no opportunity to rotate rotate capital at least nifty on a 10 year basis if you're taking such a long time it at least gives you an opportunity to rotate capital somewhere right now how effectively you do that that's a separate argument right which we'll learn subsequently on the course but the idea that I'm trying to share with you is that at least on nifty 50 if you understand even the basics of investing you will be able to rotate capital couple of times okay so if you're able to do that that makes very good return because when I'm saying that nifty 50 on an average gives well when a half percent return I assume that on a 20 year basis you bought something 20 year ago you kept on investing and never rotated capital but that's not the case all smart investors rotate capital now it's like you know Warren Buffett you do get the capital you rotate can you see I you should not try to time the market by idiots have picked up that nonsense somewhere from Mr. Warren Buffett right without even looking at what Mr. Warren Buffett himself is doing right now just simply go and search what Mr. Warren Buffett is doing okay so for example and in this case you can use a tool called as perplexity okay so just simply go Indian by loan even I right perplexity okay so you just simply go and type right how much cash is Warren Buffett sitting okay so he's sitting on 325 billion dollars in cash okay so together it's a 325 billion dollars in cash what is the portfolio size of Mr. Warren Buffett it's 600 billion dollars okay so he's sitting 50 percent cash you are like a sip you're like who is an idiot then right so if he's saying that don't time the market by himself is timing the market because goal of any investor is to have money to buy opportunities okay so I am like 30 percent invested in the US market I'm also sitting on 70 percent cash because I'm not like you know invested 100 percent but in Indian market I'm 95 percent invested okay so the point being that you know don't just simply look at what someone random quote can you know the other so hard given that people have started like you know speaking like random stuff about it yeah so the point being that you know investing is an opportunity game investing is not you know Zabharasati we have to invest only for whatever reason it's a habit is that's it's nonsense okay so see if everyone is a sip you will not make money on a sip right I mean not everyone gets rich that's basic right I mean ask your parents right look at like last three generations people who did something different made money now if sitting in 20 20 most investors are just sipping the market why will you make money right it's as simple as that if everyone starts opening an ice cream shop why will you make money from ice cream shop if everyone starts doing content creation why will you make money from content creation these are these are these are this is common sense this has got nothing to do with investing okay so I hope that this point is clear we'll take like a five minute break okay so we'll be back at 1250 okay so and I'll take the questions towards the end guys so once I'm done teaching I'll set and answer all the questions yeah
