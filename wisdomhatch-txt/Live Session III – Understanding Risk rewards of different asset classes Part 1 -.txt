==================================================

 Good morning everyone. I hope you can see me. Yes, we come up. Okay, awesome. We'll start like in a few seconds. Alrighty. Okay, so let's start. Nice and two important points. Right. So I like whenever I teach, I don't know what I'm going to teach. Okay. So like, honestly, I have a rough structure, but I teach every course very differently with the intent of adding value. And I bring like the latest possible information. So I was reviewing the recordings of like my last course that I've done. Okay, so I'll just show you that first. And when I done it, there are two video clips that I'll play. Right. I mean, of course, this is not like recorded. So you'll, you know, this is like recorded. So I could not have changed it. So when I've done that course, it was then if he was at almost 25,000. Okay. So and I just want you to listen to like some one to points that I had said here. And then we will start. The market is our whole time. What is the first most critical thing that you should do? You should have a 20 percent hedge or cash hedge. We are stopped by the portfolio. So for example, we can stop multiple portfolio. So we'll ask how much cash should you be assigned? We should be 10,000 for these sides. In the end, the market directs by 10 percent. This money would be, and you invest here. Okay. Let me look at this. This. Okay. This is a little bit, a cycle level. So this strategy is called a cash hedge. Now I cannot go back in time and change what I had said. Right. So I'm 100 percent stand by it. So if you have done it, you would have made like 10 percent returns already. Right. So you're up by the market by 10 percent every year and distance. Okay. So this was like one. Right. So whenever I'm teaching a course, I teach it as per today's market dynamics. So this course was started September of 20, 20, 14. Okay. So that is when the class recording was and at that point in time, my most critical suggestion was that have like 20 percent cash hedge. And this is something that I said on my public videos also on my YouTube channel membership. Also to my students also. Now you'll say that you're not to you say all these things on all platforms. So what's the point of joining a course? The point of joining a course is. Action ability right action ability means that you are able to understand the concept well and apply it more strongly instead of investing like 10 percent. You will have like maybe like 50 percent 60 percent more trust on it. So therefore you are able to put more money. Okay. So you are able to do it with conviction. That's the entire idea of spending like whatever 16 17 hours of your time that you're giving me. Okay. So the only thing that this course does is that it allows you to have more conviction. Okay. So please don't go around comparing your sharpening. You're going to be the point is that was when you are spending like 16 17 hours with me. Your conviction level will be very different compared to like someone randomly listening to my YouTube videos. Okay. So that's the idea or intent behind the course. That's point one point to is. Now you'll go around and you will try to like you know, pack check me because it's not as if that I am. I tell you something and you blindly believe in it. I also make mistakes. That's not I'm a human. I make a lot of mistakes and I'm open about it. But what ends up happening is that when you see a contrary opinion, please at least pack check it right. So for example yesterday I was getting a lot of questions around NPS right. That okay you said like you criticize like PF, PPS, PPS, NPS everything. But I heard that NPS is like 16 17 percent return or whatever right. So then I looked like you know, why is this like data coming up. So I was able to find a video okay on this topic. Okay. So for example, this is Neil Boorate right. So he has gone on to say and I'll just played out with you and then I'll fact check it. So I'll tell you how to fact check things. Okay. So this is the video or 0.2 percent less than the large cap natural fund return up 16.8 percent. Let's talk about NPS today. What are its pros and cons? First things first, what are the returns that NPS has given? So you can see the final return of NPS equity schemes, tier one equity schemes. It is 6.6 percent CGR. So here's written 16.6 okay and here he has admitted that mistake that it's 16.6. So what is he saying? Like literally fact based that large cap tier one equity based NPS has given 16.6. So let's fact check this okay. So here you go. You literally ask tier one NPS large cap equity. Returns. So this is between 9 to 12. Okay. So the returns of NPS large cap equity investments have ranged from 9 to 12 percent over the long term. Right. So this is blatant like that's 0.1. So I can't debate with someone 16 percent. So where did this 16 percent number come from? Okay. So then comes that okay, there are some schemes. For example, there is UTI right NPS tier one returns. Okay. This would be equity. I'll just check. Okay. So this was around 16. Right. So you some Mila Miluke. If you look at your CGR will comes out to be 16. Okay. So if you look at this particular NPS. I mean NPS like mutual funds. There are varied options. It's like me saying that you know what? If you would have that mutual funds give like 25 percent CGR large cap because quant mutual fund gives 25 percent CGR large cap. Okay. And then a FOMO will be created. You will start doubting. Yeah. So be a cookers. Okay. Right. I mean how can it be that's part one part two is that structurally see things. So fact checking these days idiots is very easy. Okay. So I'll just like point blanks it check me also. There will be a lot of mistake that I might make. Okay. But fact check it. This is your money at the end of the day. Second more structurally speaking. You have to understand the fact that why would someone give you additional returns for example if mutual funds large cap typically gives a CGR of let's say index gives you like 13 percent on an average CGR. What is it that these NPS guys are doing that they will be able to give you 16 percent you tell me and that to tax the. They might be investing in more risk here assets. So therefore you are getting 16 percent. Now NPS pension scheme do you really think that they will invest in more risk here assets. No, okay, they can't right by mandate they can't okay so even structurally logically if you think this is pure blatant lie unnecessary foremost created right now I don't have time to like you know sort of. And you know keeping bringing and fight with people and all that I'm just telling you that you might find contrary data please fact check it because at the end of the day you have to make a decision whether you're putting on money pdf e ppp Because I said you they could upload you know like shot taught like something wrong in our class that he was used to criticize like NPS NPS I'm waiting 16.5 percent tax free returns by check to go. Right I'm average is 9 to 12. Okay, so that's the. That's the basic point NPS doesn't have lower expense ratio than nifty 50 for example if you buy nip on these nifty 50 with NPS have lower expense ratio or would nifty 50 ETF will have the lowest expense ratio I would say nifty 50 ETF you can check. Okay, so why because there is no fund manager or large team require to mirror on if 50 50 ETF okay pension funds still require like on office a team to figure out where to invest they are spending money on salary. They have to do to go to go to get it from you so the point being that you know please don't like at least fact check everything just because someone is making like a shiny video don't just believe in like 16% Bully NPS and point of line Clier right I mean that's what I'll say you can literally like fact check it. So anyways the reason why I had to bring it up is that because then people start doubting you check whatever you taught it like last one it was wrong right so therefore I'm saying that you have to fact check all these things and it's not as if that I'm making up this data or I control ML. These days it's very easy to check everyone right what what they are saying okay say pure large gap funds when typically give you right see I'll tell you like basic common sense okay it's not even like you know it's very basic right for example when you go with an active mutual fund. You have to pay a manager okay and his team to scout and hunt for stocks they will charge you an expense ratio. Right I'll talk about it in like a little half of today right more right and if you are investing in index for example someone asked me or yesterday you guys were asking me that how to invest in nifty 50 ETF or mutual funds so all you do is that you buy something called as nifty bees. Okay so you buy nifty bees from your zero the car eat account or whatever here there is no manager or large team required so therefore expense ratio is low right that's the simple point okay so therefore like I mean and typically like I mean it is all data tells us that 85% of fund managers do not beat passive mutual funds even Mr Warren profit put a bet there is a very famous story that you were saying that you know what like I mean I'll give one million. To mutual fund managers who consistently beat the index and there was no one was able to win that bit okay so that's a simple point okay. A myth here is that see not there are an important point for you to know as a beginner is that see you know there are different types of mutual fund for example there are 4000 plus mutual funds in the market okay now and this can be largely categorized into index okay large cap mid cap so that's a big. Mid cap small cap sectoral okay and international so these are like five major category types and literally we don't need more than 20 mutual funds okay now is if there are like you know so many right almost like 4000 plus mutual funds there etc etc what ends up happening is that see you know quant mutual fund will keep on making the noise by our as a investor though you make like 20% CGR on large caps and they might very well be doing it but you might invest with them when when their AUM has got going on. This to this okay now handling like a 10 billion dollar portfolio is much more complicated than handling a 1 billion dollar portfolio okay just for context and again this is something that you can fact check on chat GPT right so you go and study Mr Warren Buffett's return on your vice basis right so just simply right that Warren Buffett returns decade vice okay and you'll find something very interesting okay So for example here he made 29 between the year 1965 to 1974 29.5 between this he made 25 and this is decade vice okay then 20% then 6.9 then 7.4 and then 11.8 now there'll be one thing right was Mr Warren Buffett a much smarter investor here or is he much more experienced and smarter investor at 0.2 at 0.2 he's more experienced right I mean he legends he's pro canal as a legend right and you can beat him and now right I mean this why are you a genius no like I'm we're idiots but still we can beat him why because we are what portfolio we have like 100 grots right yoga what a portfolio is that's a what is Mr Warren Buffett's portfolio it's 600 billion dollars is it easy to move an elephant or is it easy to move up you know out of like you know small dog is like faster cat is faster yes so it's more agile right so therefore like you as a small retail investor as much higher odds of rotating capital and making money Mr Warren Buffett cannot rotate money at all okay if he has to buy like a stock for example X stock for example I can buy noama well right and I bought noama well that is up like whatever 40 45% do you think that Mr Warren Buffett would even look at noama well he can not because he can buy like 100% of the company and would need to break a sweat so if he enters it he will be the owner of that company so he doesn't need all that headache okay so for him the yeah so bottom line is this that you know you have to fact check all these things and understand the difference between running like large ticket funds and small ticket funds for example when quant started quant mutual fund many of you would have invested small thought right it was small nimble it grew okay now it is big right and now generating growth is going to be challenging because the more growth you generate the harder the bigger your a u m gets the more money you have to manage and more money you have to manage the more headache it becomes for you okay always go back to this Mr Warren Buffett example everyone gets my to these two three points okay cool awesome so we'll start right so today what is it that we are going to study so very simple right so yesterday we had studied macro economics right here right today we are going to combine like these things right and we are going to do something called as fundamental analysis okay so we'll begin fundamental analysis right now I'll teach you the meaning of fundamental analysis but very quick discussion before that right about these blue questions okay for example one of the key questions that comes up in the market is that he US dollar is going to get replaced bricks currency is going to replace it gold is going to replace it Bitcoin is going to replace it so maybe like in 2025 I switch I should sell all my US denominated assets now what I US denominated assets US stocks I should sell okay if I have a house in US I should sell that US house okay I should not have any US dollar okay so is this like concern legitimate yes and no yes because US dollar is declining in value no doubt okay but at the same time economics is a very slow moving wheel okay it will take like decades for this to play out where dollar is not the primary store of wealth okay so here you need to go and understand the concept of store of wealth okay so what has happened is that see in the in like you know Mohinged are all her personalization what was the store of wealth the store of wealth was probably a lot okay for animal livestock it was artifacts right they were Paul's Pearl necklace and whatnot okay so that was the store of wealth in Mohinged are a part civilization in Aztec Egyptian civilization gold was the store of wealth okay then like I mean these are old times then we move to like 1900s okay early 1900s what was the store of wealth gold okay because pre 1920 everything was gold standard okay so gold plus silver standard and some countries move to gold some countries move to silver okay so it was primarily gold standard right then 1920 world war 1914 world war right and then to world war happened between 1914 and 1914 right and then basically the governments required a lot of money to fund these war because war is a waste it does not generate anything productive it just destroys things okay cities are eradicated decades of progress is eradicated etc etc and as a result government moved to fiat money what became the store of wealth always go back to this world so the store of wealth became government's words right that okay the government is saying that hey we are keeping $100 into our treasury worth of gold into our treasury right and storing it like in gold right that was gold standard so governments act that we don't need to do it just trust us okay we don't need to do it if anything happens we are there to save your ass okay so just trust us and this was called as fiat money or start of the fiat money okay fiat money so we moved from gold standard to a fiat standard when by 1973 okay so this transition was completed in 1973 of moving from gold to fiat okay and between 1930 and 1970 we were on and off gold standard for example during this phase US government seized gold from people okay why because it had to like you know fund war it was late to the war and all that why did US empire grew and right now like I mean since 1973 to 2025 what has been the number one winning advantage of US dollar or US it's the US dollar because they have been able to export their currency itself to the world yeah for example yesterday I explained the concept that a country truly grows rich if they export something of value for example when India was called the golden bird it used to export participated 25% of the world trade we were a net exporter okay so we were exporting things bringing foreign money into our nation we were exporting something when India was occupied by the Britishers what did Britishers used to do this government this government called it a British Raj so what they used to do was that they used to you know sort of grab like raw material from India take it to Manchester make sure it's sell it back in India okay so they used to do that right so again it was an export for them right that they were able to procure cheap material process it I'd value to it bring it back to Indians L.a.t.a or whatever right and that's how they used to export with okay for example in a railway line valley which is a facility from Indians right and whatever right and got it to like Manchester whatever so British Empire got stronger okay now that was 1800s 1900 what started happening US Empire started to gain strength why because they started exporting US dollar to the world now is that still happening yes even today as of 2025 almost 60 65% of the world trade happens in the US dollar okay so the natural question comes that will the US dollar get weekend over time yes but will it happen in our lifetime I don't know should you change your investment strategy in 3 to 5 years no should you think beyond that no okay so that's the more logical way of thinking about from an investing point of view about the chai pe chacha karni and all that stuff that's a separate argument altogether we can like all debate and you know sort of do that intellectual exercise but from an investing point of view nothing changes in terms of US dollar right for the next 3 to 5 years that's what I would say okay the change is fairly slow okay so this is right I hope this point is clear and it answers this question that will US dollar get the preplaced okay second key point is that you always need to go back to the question and this is something that I can't solve for you you need to have a clarity that what type of an investor you are okay so for example some people for example I have friends right and one friend only investment BTC okay Marama guys up right I'm only going to buy BTC that's it 100% of his investment is in BTC he does not own a house it does not own anything only BTC that's it okay so that's what he does right I have friends who only invest in every is okay I have friends who only buy real estate okay can I comment like I mean who is right who is wrong no because I don't know where the world will be in 5 years 10 years from now okay what type of an investor I am so I find most comfort in being diversified okay now how do I diversify I diversify using brain okay now what is the meaning of diversification for example if I feel that private banks are undervalued okay how to find the evaluation all that I'll explain today but let's assume that private banks are undervalued what will I do okay so I'll buy index also I'll buy HDFC bank also I'll bet codec bank also I'll buy IC IC I bank also I'll buy access also and I'm done okay and let's say if my budget is to invest like 10 lakhs in this theme then I'll put 2 to lakhs every and okay so that's what diversification for me is then I'll ask the next question that okay I'll be are it looks very undervalued no can I like you know do something else right so for example if I enter finance looks very undervalued okay so another example will be real estate and I am bullish I have been bullish on real estate I believe that it's going to do well in the future in India everywhere so I started buying real estate in South Goa yeah it went up very happy with my investment I recently made another investment in South Goa then I bought one apartment in Dubai okay I learned more about Dubai real estate market okay then I bought one real estate in Bangkok okay this is for my own use right so this is not really an investment investment so what I started doing was that I started thinking that okay real estate is great asset class for me but if I have to diversify more what kind of additional diversification I can add well I can add geographical diversification right so geographical diversification gives me a lot of benefits for example when I bought my Dubai first property last year dirhams was at 23.0 something now it is at 24 so 5% without doing anything my property has gone up why because of the room appreciation because I bought that entire money from India converted that into dirhams right and bought that property there because I did not have any credit history in UA last year but there is a reason because I have started making little bit of money there so now I have credit history so it gives me like diversification benefits now see I can't tell you that you know what type of an investor you should be okay but what I can help you understand is that there are pros and cons to everything okay so which brings us to a very quick input on the concept of concentration versus diversification and why I am a proponent of diversification okay concentration means that hey 5 stocks in entire portfolio and you are done okay diversification means I don't know what will happen in the world right I am very pessimistic okay so what I will do is that I will diversify as much as possible and solve that grid problem for me okay so and I will try to have three types of diversification number one I am going to have asset class diversification which means that I am going to invest in stocks also Bitcoin also high quality assets real estate also high quality real estate okay so as long as I am getting like a good asset for example a land is a high quality real estate and if I am getting that land at good price I will buy it okay similarly if I find HDFC which is a high quality asset at a good price I will buy it so my objective as an investor is this okay so I solve for first equation which is asset class diversification every one understands second call second point it is called as geographical diversification so for example I and I are falling if let's say if my job is also in India and if I own all the properties in India all my stocks on an India then what's the risk that I'm holding I'm holding a geography risk okay so I hope you guys are able to hear me there was a little bit of lag yeah so that's a geography risk right now for some reason right you know there is like you know some tax issue right key Indian government comes and say is that you want 30% tax on every capital gains all types that's a geography risk okay now third risk is called as currency risk okay so currency risk is that if all your assets are India denominated then everything is dependent on India currency okay now we might now it might happen that you know some some issue happens within currency or Asian crisis happens or whatever then there is this risk also so for me diversifying across all these three segments is critical so I hope I'm able to explain your point and what is the perspective with which I diversify so I diversify with this perspective right that I had shown you this grid okay this grid that I need to get a head of the end green check every there so for example cash flow I have a very strong cash flow from my Dubai property okay I have a very strong growth on my India property okay if I look at Bitcoin this gives me growth benefits for example if I show you chart of Bitcoin BTC okay price okay so what you will see right on five year basis Bitcoin has given 1500% returns it has gone 15 times okay last one year 35 it has beaten stock market you look at any three year phase Bitcoin has outperformed every single asset class that is out there on earth so for me it kind of makes sense to have what like little bit of portfolio here okay so why because it solves growth problem okay so I'll have like 10% of my portfolio here okay unlisted stocks now again that solves this growth portfolio okay so they are likely to grow faster than small caps at least the good ones okay so that is their gold if I am wealth protection if if this is the need then I'll buy gold do I buy too much gold no because I don't need wealth protection because if I'm already diversifying for all these three different types of things then automatically my wealth will be protected are you getting okay so honestly this is a conversation you have to draw it up on a spreadsheet figure out what style of investing works better for you and at the end of the day you need to have like an assessment of your network with a pie chart in mind okay so I'll tell you I'm see I'm a hundred CR plus I okay so I've built this wealth on my own okay so let's assume you have kept KITNIA 100 see as I that's useless okay so like my so this is my network if I aggregate all my properties all my stock investing all my international investing etc etc it will be this much okay now what do I need to do right I need to now make a call that how much money do I need to put for growth how much money I need to put for cash flows and how much money do I need to put for wealth protection everyone let me okay so growth I put now because I'm on the younger side I put like 60% for growth so this will be equities this will be US equities Indian equities right US equities this will be cryptos right this will be unlisted stocks this will be my angel investments in some companies okay all that stuff okay now cash flow for example Dubai real estate is a very good if you buy strategic good Dubai real estate it's very good for what cash flows now just to give you an example so I bought a property at 1.4 million dirhams okay in fact I will see because Dubai with the data is also going to be right so it's not as if I can you know sort of rule anyone right so I'll just quickly show it to you for example here is a website to you just go on bail okay and I bought a property here okay so I'll just show you okay my internet is a little bit slow so this called as just a second just a second just give me a second I'll just ask my like maybe my kid is like using what you do or something that's on it okay okay okay yeah all right so hopefully it should be up in a minute okay so all right so I'll just weekly showing right so any as I think the website is not loading for some reason I'll come back to it okay so somebody is on loading I'll activate it whenever it the website is up I think it's generally slow today okay so anyways the point being and I'll just explain it to you verbally and then time permits I'll show you like they're also so basically I bought like a property at 1.4 million dirhams right and now it rents for 120k right and after maintenance everything I make a net yield of 7.25% okay so which is fabulous because this property is free for me why because if I were to borrow against this property I'll get a home loan at 5.5% so without spending much money I get to like a sort of pocket like whatever one and a half percent gains every year okay so which is fabulous right so this is a net cash flow property for me okay so this solves my cash flow equation now honestly like you as an investor you need to have like a very good sense what problem you're solving and have that conversation with you that what specific assets are going to solve so chapter like these I'll just show you right so okay so this is where I had purchased right so this was a two-bedroom property that I had bought okay and in fact if you now properties are going for 1.9 also here and I'll show you that transaction right so I had bought it in November so you you see this 1.4 this was mine okay so fourth November I had bought it with three of my investors okay so you will see in fact you can see all the data right so if you go and check you will see three transactions around this price so these were done by me and two of my investors and you will see and I had rented it right so you'll see that some are going for like 1.13 150 so I was able to rent it three were purchased by us okay on all around like this time right fourth November okay and if you take a look at the rent that we are getting so 130 baby child I coach 1.13 1.5 I had rented it out it is this look okay so anyways if you find it you'll see like you know I was able to rent it at 120 okay so I was just showing you the proof so the big government actually puts all the data on the blockchains so you can actually check everything that okay so this is the website you can go and hunt for properties and this is a very good website to learn about UAE real estate investing as well okay there is still connection problem okay so okay just give me a second I hope it should be okay now but I'll just double check if like you know my family members have you know so you stop all the internet services okay so all right I hope that this is okay now and when my internet seems to be okay now like in case something happens yeah it should be okay now yeah all right yeah it's showing full words should be okay okay all right so okay the website name was Bayuth BAYUT right so it's you can go and check all the transaction data the big government puts everything on a block chain right and that's that okay so anyways the point is that you need to figure out now this is not a push that you go and buy something in Dubai you not buy something in Dubai the idea is always to do what the idea is to do this right that you get green signals somewhere right from this entire grid and overall you have like some greens throughout okay so that's the idea okay so for me this does not meet any criteria so I don't put any money here and I don't recommend people put any money here unless it's absolutely mandated for you okay so that's the message that I'm giving okay now comes that this we discuss what can you do if stock market prepares by 50% what will be your uh strategy can you time the market now this is something that I will talk a little bit more about and to understand this what you need to do is that you need to go and study the basics okay so the first key thing is that you must understand and there are 11 points that we will study today and the first key point is that you must understand what exactly an equity is okay so for example if we go here right now you'll see the name Kotech Mahindra Bank okay now what is the meaning of like this market cap what is the meaning of this current price uh how can you buy all this right why should you buy so basically the story starts when Kotech Mahindra Bank was a very small bank okay now this was a business because when you buy a stock or an equity what are you buying you are buying ownership in a business okay so for example if Kotech Mahindra Bank has total number of shares which are 100 okay and you buy 1% of the company this then you become 1% owner of Kotech Mahindra Bank now Kotech Mahindra Bank might have thousands of outstanding shares so when you go and buy one stock at 2079 to piece you are becoming a 0.0001% owner of Kotech Mahindra Bank but nevertheless whenever you buy a stock you become a owner in that company everyone understand this is 0.1 okay now when a company is starting for example I ran a company called his wisdom hatch okay this is an unlisted company it's a very small company okay this is literally like stage one and who owns this company I own this company 100% I have not listed it on the stock exchange I have not raised any DC money I have not there is no private equity fund which is investing in short I don't have any other investor except for me okay so this is a boot strapped company so this is the meaning of a boot strapped company most companies start this way and over time they become like bigger okay then they become even bigger then they become like this and then they eventually IPO and investors like you and me which are called as retail investors we can buy ownership in this company post-type you everyone understands or during IPO this is the most common of buying ownership in a company okay so it's not equity investing it's basically a much better way of looking at it is that you become a part owner of a company okay now do companies have some other route also of now why would company sell its stock that's a very natural question right for example if I'm wisdom hatch and I own 100% of this company why would I sell stock of my company and reduce my equity ownership for example if I decide to sell 40% stake in my company I will only be having 60% of the company okay so this belongs to Akshath and Akshath has sold 40% of the company to others okay now my first step usually is to raise VC funds that I will go to private investors VCs all that and I'll say that boss buy my company it's a brilliant company here is Excel spreadsheet and it will make a lot of money in the next 10-20 years so jump on this growth bandwagon okay so what is it that I am doing I am selling my equity for example shark tank show that you see what is the show about the show is mostly about selling your equity to sharks okay so they are finding these initial set of investors okay now without going and boring you with the details here why would an owner sell his company it's very simple because he's able to add up the multiple to his business okay so for example right now what is the valuation of my company right now what is the meaning of valuation right so it simply means so there are various valuation models okay so very similar to how you know for example valuation models are Excel models okay so what we do is there is something called as present value of future cash flows now let's say that wisdom hatch this year made 10 growth okay next year it is expected to make 15 growths then after that it's expected to make 25 growths so on and so forth okay so it's the case it's already now mathematically if I have to calculate the present value of future cash flows what I need to do is that I have to discount it to 2025 so this is called as present value present value is what 2025 value of wisdom hatch based on my future cash flow projections okay everyone is understanding this 15 growth is not my 2025 revenue this is my 2026 revenue this is my 2027 revenue okay so I have to discount it by a certain rate okay this is called as discount rate or whatever okay now this is a complex mathematical formula and this is also called as hurdle rate or internal rate of return Vagera Vagera and then we get into like that MBA language okay but if we have to just as a layman understand what is the meaning of present value of future cash flows this is what it means right that for example this is a stock right and the current price how do you reach this current price 2076 okay basically someone would have prepared an Excel model present value of future cash flows of Potec Mindra bank okay one just a mangee 100 crores a next year 150 you will go one plus x over two all that formula formula and this gives you present value okay important point to notice that this number is up for debate okay because if I give this exercise to three different analysts they will all come up with different different assumptions okay so this is an Excel model right now you'll get very pissed off that okay you know there is no way to determine the intrinsic value or the true value of a company no okay you can only do mootamotamat right there is no way that you can figure out what the true value of a company is okay how can you check so again perplexity go on perplexity ask a question what is the intrinsic value of Tesla now here when you are running and getting these estimate this is called as discounted cash flow so the model that I just explained you present value of future cash flow that is called as discounted cash flow model also okay now there are 100 different methods of doing this now one method is telling you that a there is the current price should be 46.76 another guy is telling you 69.27 okay based on this method it's 212 based on this method it's 31 based on this it is 69 so you will see these very huge variations okay so which model to trust I think you cannot estimate okay so basically it's just a good intellectual exercise okay so everyone is wrong about valuation now can I prove it to you yes okay for example if you go to a business school top business school if you have been to London business school Harvard and Ferdinsey ad will read a textbook by a professor called as Ashwad Damudran okay so he's the dean of valuation so that's what his only job in life is to do valuation of the company okay now he gave a target of 45 rupees on Zomato okay and if you were to believe him right you would have never bought Zomato and now Zomato is at 2500 300 rupees the point is that I'm not trying to criticize him he's wonderful try it gives you an idea but what I'm trying to tell you is that even dean of valuation is wrong about valuations most of that time and he himself says it it's not just me who is saying it okay so the point being that this is a good exercise for you to understand a viewpoint but you can't base your decisions that okay this is the intrinsic value of the company and therefore should have bite every non-understands okay why now why is that is give you to some funnets right the fund is very simple that's he it is very difficult for me to put the correct value of wisdom hatch okay it can grow like this also or it can grow like this become this and then become this again okay it depends on what things it depends on a lot of tangible and intangible factors now what are tangible factors for example if India's economy is growing really fast if the interest in the stock market is growing really fast then the valuation of my company will also grow really fast now that is beyond my control if for example Indian government decides to give to make like course purchases GST free okay then it will benefit me okay or they will say use the tax free curve right if we want people to study more take more courses become more financially literate and all that stuff if they take opposite action it's a problem 100 different variables it depends on my motivation level for example I don't even promote my courses okay have you ever seen like a paid ad that I run no like I mean I never do it I've never done it right so like if my goal was to make like more money I would have advertised the hell out of my courses right but I never do it okay so like I have no motivation to sell like crazy amount of my courses I make it like big capacity right and run like a number of batches a year and I'm done okay so it really depends on a lot of things right for example if I change my strategy if I were if I had a VC on board they would have asked me to run like paid ads right I mean every day on YouTube you would have seen my ads or whatever right but none of you would have seen any of my ads okay so point being that there are like you know we can't estimate right and what rate the company even wants to grow so there are 100 numerous factors and it's impossible to figure out the intrinsic value of a company people can you can study take 15 20 courses try to estimate it according to me it's a useless exercise so I don't even try doing it right now you'll say that okay then what's a point well understanding what you can do versus what you can't do and being true about it actually solves a lot of problem for you okay the moment you acknowledge the fact that the companies can't be valued you can only come up with a broad range it kind of humbles you and it kind of makes you understand that you have to be diversified and you have to make broad decisions you can't make microdiscisions everyone with me okay now so then what do we do like I mean do we just randomly like you know put a finger up in the air and just buy whatever no we do it via PE ratio okay this is the most powerful ratio right and if you know how to use it well it kind of solves a lot of issues for you okay now what ends up happening is that when you start investing you will always look at price that's it okay what you will see is that okay area stock but it is going up so I'll buy it okay because it will constantly forever like I'm if you speak with like a money manager who will you know last 20 years you know go to Minderavan because we were like 20 person so in next 20 years it will again give to help us and so you can't do all this okay so this is like because you're only looking at price okay price always needs to be seen in context of its earning okay now what do I mean mother for example it's like your salary should be seen in context of your skills okay if you just simply say that you know what I used to make like 10 lacks and now in like 2020 now I'm making 50 lacks and you ask that should I do I deserve this 50 lack salary half of the idiots will say no like even it's such fast salary in case you should not happen this that stuff this that by the way they go with okay what skills have I developed right so that is a natural response that you will give me because in 2020 I used to help my company make when my 10 lakh rupees salary I used to help the company make 20 lacks okay hypothetically so company used to pay me 10 lacks now I'm getting 50 lacks salary from my company because I'm helping my company make 5 crores so maybe like even this 50 lack is underpaid are you getting what I'm trying to say so therefore like number one thing that you need to do in the stock market says never look at price of a stock alone okay it's useless okay you have to figure out like a broad broad math of understanding the valuation every one with me okay so this PE ratio is like your salary to skill ratio okay so for example if a company price is high okay but in the future its earnings can also go high okay then probably it's okay for you to buy it by that company at the top okay but on the flip side if the industry shrinking industry prospects are not there business sucks okay the company's losing market share hundred different problems happening with the company and the company is overvalued should you buy that company no okay so these are qualitative factors that you can judge to figure out the price okay so now let me help you understand how you analyze PE ratio and what is the meaning of PE ratio so PE so there are two types of in fact multiple types of PE ratio one is the current PE ratio so what do you see here is for example 20 this is the current price to earning ratio okay or like yeah okay now there is something called as forward PE ratio okay so forward PE comes up to you in the next 12 months what is going to happen to be or me okay so what we need to worry about a company is forward P not necessarily the current P okay for example this stock is available at 2079 okay and this is the current price or a current price of the stock okay so for example here if you check right okay what you will notice is this matrix it is called as earning per share EPS earning per share so what you will notice from this that there has been a consistent increase in earning per share okay now let's say that this is for the year 2025 right so this what we need 25 let's add 2026 man right let's say that this becomes 180 EPS okay and the stock price remains the same for example here the stock price was 2000 and here in 2025 it was 2000 here also it remains 2000 now because earning per share has expanded by roughly like you know what like 40% 33 40% the PE ratio will come down by 40% do you understand how okay why because earning per share EPS is increasing okay and price is staying the same so now because the denominator is increasing the PE ratio will come down further okay and as long as the company keeps on increasing its profits revenues more importantly profits and its EPS earning per share the PE ratio will keep going down and down okay so this is called as absolute PE analysis okay so the first type of analysis that you need to do on PE ratio is called as absolute PE three analysis that you need to number one is called as PE absolute okay number two is PE industry and number three PE of peers okay so all these three PEs need to be looked in conjunction with each other okay it's not as if that you can just analyze this and you're done or you can just analyze this and you're done or you can just analyze this and you're done you have to see all these three things together okay so we start with the industry PE first okay so industry PE so what type of a bank is Kotech Mindra bank it's a private bank in Indian okay and what typically like is the private bank PE right so if you study the history you will see this dotted line that roughly the PE of Kotech Mindra bank in the past has existed at around 30 okay then you look at other top banks also similar category right so access bank of PE they go there you'll get this cash bus never look at prices is useless okay it's not right I mean it's like whatever like 15 16 up HDFC they go right um HDFC bank okay okay so here you will see like 20 and all that right so now you use little bit of publicity right you ask that what is the average P what is the the historic PE of Indian top private so you will get wide range right for example atara bees these and all that okay now so basically right now if you just ballpark it just for example Kuchbang's a 31 Kuchbang's a 18 Kuchbang's a 20 and you have to you can see industry PE of private bank so we are trying to analyze the industry PE you know industry PE of private sector banks in India okay okay so industry comparison see the average P for banking industry has seen fluctuations dropping from 46 all the way till 14 okay so now you will get a range okay so of course you're not going to get like a solid number okay so this is like a data that we were looking at right so what do we see that okay the industry PE of private banks in India is roughly like between 14 and 44 okay a set times it can go to 44 also in bad times it can fall to 14 also everyone with me right so we go to Kotech Minder bank again right we were analyzing that now what is like now if we kind of see like the PE ratio like of the industry it was between 14 and 44 okay so this is the data that we get okay so now this is where like this is if we plot it this is this could be termed as fair right I mean because Kotech Minder bank compared to an average private bank it will consider come up in the top category okay everyone with me so here you know what how to do it so it's like from an industry PE wise at least it does not look over valued is this a statement that we can make we can make that right so reasonably okay what's the second thing that okay absolute P this is the second P analysis that we need to do so here the average PE of Kotech Minder bank is 30 okay in the last five years okay last five years and here we are getting it at 21 so is this undervalued yes definitely undervalued how much 33% right so significant difference even if it goes back to its previous PE that's very nice okay then we look at peers that is it like comparable or is it like way off for example ICICI is almost like 19 this is 21 this is 20 so cut cut paper hour right I mean it's almost at similar scale it's not as if that this is massively overvalued or undervalued rough rough net net it's fair so all three PE criteria get passed everyone with me industry P seems fair absolute P seems fair PRP seems fair okay we are not trying to figure out undervaluation we are just trying to see if it is not off the charts right as I need to know that industry P typically is like you know 20 and this stock is trading at 90 okay that should not happen right as long as overvaluation is not there it's fine so we are just trying to discard bad things okay so if we find like any red flags we cut that stock okay then what is the next most important question that we need to estimate the next most important question we need to estimate is that what is likely to be the forward P of Kotech Minder bank okay now how do you estimate this it's very simple see if the profits are likely to expand further if earnings are likely to expand further the earnings will improve and as a result the P will fall that's option one or the price will rise and P will remain the same you got how because if earnings are growing profits are growing then E is also growing and if E is growing then P multiple is coming less okay this is one scenario so the P will get cheaper or the second thing that will happen is that the price will also rise and the P will remain the same okay so this is this fourth trigger is very very important because if you feel that the stock revenue wise and profit wise is in a bullish momentum okay so for example here is momentum and you can judge it for example every quarter on quarter if you take a look profits have gone up right so 2024 the data is not right profits have gone up right here a little bit of shrinkage right if you look at it on a year wise basis with the revenues may not be taken out there you have to look at a year wise basis so all time high profits sorry revenues all time high profits if you look at TTM which is last 12 months all time high revenues all time high profits so is the forward P in the earnings is it going to grow or is it going to shrink the earnings is going to grow okay so either the stock price should go up or the P will come down okay so this is the bottom line right so I hope that this point is clear okay and therefore it is somewhat undervalued so this is called as fundamental analysis now what people typically will tell you is that how to do fundamental analysis right I'll talk about SBI also okay now now the way people will tell you about fundamental analysis is that you judge the quality of management can you judge quality of management as the government a CEO but others just to say new san al-kaake meh churu right please mehri company investment okay name like one CEO that I'm the biggest thief in the world right please don't invest in my company zero okay they will not so how will you judge the quality of management you will not know okay that's point one point two if you read the last 10 year annual report can you judge what the company is going to do in 11th 12th year you can't okay you can't do it okay you need to have like a business sense okay so you have to think like an entrepreneur right that's the best way of judging the judging the doing fundamental analysis okay for example now how do we think like an entrepreneur okay if you were to start a business today in India which industry will you pick and why EV finance okay consumption okay finance karma okay right so all right things why because tourism education finance EV 2v2 why these are growth industries okay so the first thing that you need to check is that hey is this industry a growth industry or not okay now what is the sign of a growth industry okay so just give me a second okay so what do you do is that what the simple thing is a basically see you will the first criteria of starting a business in India is that at least and all of you picked growth industries correct no one said yeah mehkudana wuganay right I mean analog cameras one on it right so I mean no one said that why because there is no growth rate on analog cameras or the growth rate is very bad okay so you'll always pick a growth industry now why are you picking a growth industry because p multiple you get on growth businesses for example today you might have heard the stories that in 2000 before dot com bubble people were just raising money on powerpoint slides they used to send powerpoint slides and we see used to give them money at a multiple of 100 200 whatever okay why because everyone was excited to chase the trend okay right now what is that trend AI semiconductor machine learning etc right computer vision whatever right so what equation Jenny I right etc right so these are inherently high multiple industries for example kisi ko sir par ni wata ki why the banking p should be 44 or why the banking should be 21 okay it just trades on this range of 21 to 44 or whatever like 14 to 20 44 why because of sentiments okay if more people feel that you know next five 10 years belong to this particular industry like semiconductor etc etc then a higher p multiple will be attached to that industry if people feel that this industry is not going to grow really fast people will not build too much in that industry and it will go away okay from that okay I hope that this point is clear that why does our stock ranges between a certain p this has got less to do with fundamentals and more to do with sentiments okay and understanding sentiments is the fastest way of making money right stock market is less about finance and more about understanding sentiments okay what should you do when people are panicking you should buy when people are very you know happy you should sell okay that's a simple do leave and if you follow this you'll make money okay why because this is pure sentiments okay so that's a bottom line for example some of you ask me that actually are you investing in gold right now no why because people are extremely bullish on gold right now right so why would I invest now maybe I'll wait for like two three years when there is slight correction or whatever then I'll see right now and now then what makes you so patient right some people ask me because it's not as if that I you know I do meditate in meditation in the morning and all that I don't do that right I'm like I'm but the thing is that I have a lot of asset classes to invest my money in right so there are if I'm tracking 20 asset classes I don't necessarily need to go to gold I if I'm finding a good property in Dubai right I'll probably buy that if I'm finding a good property in Goa I'll probably buy that if I'm finding good stalls I'll probably buy that if I am getting good unlisted I'll probably buy that so I don't need to chase gold but if you're a pure gold investor what what does that lead to it leads to desperation the way I was the car over I write I mean you know what okay I've been hardly any growth what will I do gold in me like that because that is going off right so that desperation is why people lose money okay I hope everyone understands and this was insightful okay so okay so coming back right okay so if you take a look at banking sector and if you just ask chat GPT at what rate banking sector is growing in India so it's growing approximately 13 to 14 percent right now is this higher than the GDP growth of India yes okay so for example this means what that if GDP is growing if GDP is growing something like this okay what will happen to banking sector it will grow something like this correct so this is growing faster than the GDP so first for the first criteria of doing growth investing is or putting money for growth is in invest in sectors which are growing faster than the GDP okay now agriculture should you invest in agriculture in India or agriculture and stocks just say many of you get excited sugar industry you stocks are yielding if I'm not yielding and all that stuff structurally right answer is move okay why because the productivity add on agriculture stock is really bad okay in public markets right I mean if you're buying and you know seed stage companies and all that that's different but agree based companies right they are usually bad okay what about manufacturing no manufacturing is a very capital intensive business all those problems are there there's generally checked like criteria number one is that that sector should be growing faster than the economy if that sector itself is not growing faster than the economy and as no track record of growing faster than the economy then there is no point in investing in those companies okay now some businesses are cyclical in nature for example real estate now real estate you would have seen that there is a cycle very good cycle for five six years seven years everyone makes money then everyone loses money for five six years seven years seven years okay then again cycle repeats same happens with PSU stocks that cycle right everyone makes money then everyone loses money okay so you have to understand the intrinsic nature of every asset that you're owning so today we are speaking about banks a little bit like in subsequent classes I would take you through like different different industry then help you understand the nuanced points but to cut the long story short right if you're looking at something like Kotech Mindra Bank the first key thing that you will you will have to understand is that hey is it like a good asset yes it is a good asset I'll give you like an 18 point checklist into night session or like you know next week session which will help you understand how to check whether an asset is good or not and we'll take like a few stocks through that criteria but let's assume that Kotech Mindra Bank is a good asset number two if you have to check valuation that is very very complicated to do it depends on the stage of the company 100 different things but an easier way of doing that in public market because here we are studying a listed company is what that you do for things one is track industry P track absolute P of the company track relative P of the company and finally track the fact whether the earnings are going to go up or EPS is going to go up or not now you have a one here not that jotech with the any shelter here right I mean whether it will grow up and grow up and grow up and you see that EPS is going up it's not as if you know banks are going to shrink in size or whatever you continue to invest not a problem okay so this is the reason why having like something like Kotech Mindra Bank kind of makes sense from a fundamental viewpoint okay now what type of analysis that you need to do on a stock so I'll just zoom out and give you a big picture okay so big picture is that see number one analysis that you need to do is the analysis of macro economy okay if the macro looks bad then you get out okay or you have a 20% hitch 30% hitch second is called as fundamental analysis what I'm just trying to teach you we will have deeper class on this also okay third is called as technical okay analysis and fourth is called as portfolio analysis okay whether it fits your portfolio for example it should not be that okay not Kotech Mindra Bank is great everything is great this also looks good first three factors look great 100% of my money is on Kotech Mindra Bank that should not happen okay so it should make sense for your portfolio also okay so these are like four factors that we are looking at today we are just understanding this sliver of fundamentals I'm just introducing you to this topic okay important point to think is to think like a businessman right and the first criteria to think like a businessman is to pick a growth industry now our banks are growth industry in India yes okay why because tam there is something called as total addressable market that is expanding banks on other hand are also crooks right they charge you on everything right especially Indian banks right and all that stuff so they are crazy profit making businesses right so it's not as a and they are very stable right so again when I take you in the next class through that 18 point analysis I will take you through that story right but fundamentally speaking there is nothing off on banks one very simple way or a quick way of analyzing this is just check if it typically grows faster than the economy okay now let's change the question let's change the question to US economy now what is a good sector definitely to invest take okay why take okay because the growth rate of take is almost 10x or not 10x maybe at least x67x that of the US economies that's a fact okay so for example AI is growing at what 20% a year US economy grows at maybe 4% a year right which 5x stronger than the US economy right so therefore it kind of makes sense to be a general investor in tech slash okay another way like I mean I'll just tell you I'll actually show you the data also so for example go here right on trading view okay just trading you let's want there okay okay so here what do you do is that you go here right and you compare like US broad market with US tech market so for example if you look at excel gate right so this is a tech index right so this is index okay and you compare it with S&P 500 right so this is spx which is S&P 500 since 2012 S&P 500 has gone up by 329% and excel gate which is a tech index similar to Nasdaq it has gone up by 881% why because excel gate is a tech focused index spx is the broad market broad market means this includes more tech this includes like you know manufacturing this includes agriculture this is broad 500 stocks in the US okay so generally right as a general rule where should you be investing your money in the US in tech because that is where major growth is coming from in the US okay so everyone understands that you know at a sectoral level why it's super easy to like you know sort of eliminate things for example what is another growth industry in India healthcare right so that is huge right healthcare is a sticky business it's if you check the recent performance of healthcare so if you're doing SIP on healthcare or SIP on banks is it okay to do it yes okay why because these are generally going faster than the economy okay so it's okay to do that right you create like a block of like 10 15 stocks that you trust and do SIP in that you how much commissions will you be paying answer is 0 okay so you don't have to pay any commission on that SIP right 15 so here money saved right horse for your school so all the all that's all you need to do right so you can easily do that okay that's not an issue okay which other industry do you think is okay so if I have just have to tell you like very quickly wrap up this conversation right and then we'll take a quick break there are three types of industries that are out there okay number one right you have growth right for example in India if you're talking about right it would be banks which will grow faster than the economy healthcare okay which will grow what are low growth which will definitely not grow faster than the economy manufacturing agree okay this will not happen okay then there are uncertain industries what are uncertain industries for example data center IT okay will it grow will it not grow I don't know okay so if you have confidence go and invest if you don't have confidence don't invest I don't know like I'm in with a data center will grow at what pace it will grow and all that stuff because technically the way I understand is the data center you require larger space again real estate is very expensive in India the new companies that are coming up at what valuation are they coming up there are 100 different like you know criteria that you need to understand so there is no certainty around it for example if a Daringi decided to be a humidious interview will I right so then guy right I mean whatever businesses you are investing in right now on data center okay so basically like you have to understand like are there any broad red flags on an industry okay that's how I will look at it okay but I but I hope that you got the understanding that okay what is the meaning of a business when you want to stop what is the meaning you should not look at price you should look at price to earning and if you're analyzing price to earning to figure out the valuation of the company the most easiest way of doing it is very simple that look at four factors absolute P relative P PRP and forward P right and try to guess what that is that industry is going to grow or not and finally is the disruption point okay that what is the probability of that business getting disrupted okay for example what is the probability of banking industry getting disrupted in India and by whom okay so for example do you think that a Dhani Ji can own a bank very quickly in India will be good for like generally no it's not that easy okay because then banks will give loans to his own company which is like it's just tough to do right and therefore a money is to not own a bank right technically on top of that you might think that okay cryptocurrency is very destroyed like banks in India why you are so Bhajdhiyo in the crypto all over right so I mean no that and even if that happens it will be done through primary banks to appoint a MD CEO of a private bank like HDFC or Kotech Mindra bank where does that private bank need to take permission or whom does it need to take permission from RBI okay so a private business has to take permission from RBI to change the board member okay from RBI right so private banks are technically an extended arm of the government okay it is as regulated as it gets and therefore disrupting it is close to impossible for example if I want to start a bank in India I can't do it okay at this stage okay so it's close to impossible for me to start a bank okay but if I have to start a YouTube channel or if I have to start like a crypto based startup etc that I can do okay so the point is that these things so wherever you find stickiness that okay this business is not going to get disrupted that's possibly an okay business and it will have a more stable P okay so for example it will not happen you know see the beast it does so jaihos for P right crypto forces in the making no I'm not doing like I don't teach that much guys I mean I maybe like do like six sevens a year right so like including my classes okay so I keep like my life time free okay so yeah so to cut the long story short this is how you need to think now we will just I give you a flavor of fundamental understanding is now in the next session I'll give you a flavor of what market analysis right so you'll study the data from a market point of view right and then we will deep dive into fundamental class so this class is divided into two so in the evening we will do like a fundamental analysis class more but here we will pause fundamental analysis because I just wanted to give you a flavor of what business means okay and now I will help you understand why a business goes up in price and down in price okay and why does the stock goes up in price down in price and who are the major movers of this entire game okay okay so let's take like a five minute break and let's be back at 1246 okay
