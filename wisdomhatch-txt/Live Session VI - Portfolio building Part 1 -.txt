==================================================

 So in the morning time we studied like how to do business analysis just a very quick taking a look at where okay awesome. All right, so on this class so yeah, so in the VR right so number one point is that we studied like macros right number two we studied like something called as fundamental analysis. Third, we studied something called as business analysis and we will be studying technical analysis. If you add all these four things it gives you a better sense on whether or not you should be buying any asset be it like real estate, be it like stocks whatever you want to do right and finally like I mean you need to plug all this in context of your portfolio. And your personal goals whatever it is okay. So we touched upon like business analysis and I gave you like a list of 17 points right. And one point was remaining which had to do with value chain right value chain. Now value chain simply means that ideally and business analysis what does it allow us to do it allows us to answer the question that the asset or the stock that you are buying is it good quality okay. We are not talking about good price okay good price we will talk tomorrow. Today we are talking good quality okay. Now what are typically good quality businesses which are on the right hand side of the value chain okay. These businesses have brands right. On the left hand side of the value chain we have something called as commodities for example sugar, coal, power, steel, aluminum, copper, oil. We should not be typically buying these type of businesses these are cyclical businesses okay. Now as a general rule we will not buy them. We will buy businesses that are on the right hand side of the equation because what happens is that if you are buying businesses on the right hand side of the value chain. It gives the company a pricing power now brand itself is massively valuable and very difficult to replicate okay. For example Zomato we spoke about the mode of Zomato in the morning. Mode means competitive advantage. What is the difference between Zomato and Akshat? Well Zomato has a strong brand but if Zomato gets into teaching about stock markets you will you take like Zomato stock market course okay. The answer is no because it is not their mode that is my mode okay. So the point is that brands are there everywhere. The stronger the brand the stronger the personal story the better it is okay. And this is where this is very difficult to replicate right. So for example you will say that Akshat you know there are like so many finance influences now. Like so how are you different? Well I am I live a life right in the sense that okay I have I am not just preaching I am actually doing I run a hedge fund right. It's not as if that I am just simply speaking about like a mutual fund with a low mutual fund with all that stuff. I am genuinely investing my money right. 99% of finance influences if you make them speak on camera or like two hours straight life it will be difficult right. How you can only do it if you are truly passionate about like you have been doing this day and day out okay. So that's the difference right. So bottom line is that brands come from personal stories brands come from how someone has cultivated that angle which they are interested in. And you hear the word apple there is a certain certain brand image that you would have right and this is the most valuable thing. So that's the entire idea right. For example many brands there is a very good documentary on Netflix. I am forgetting the name someone just remind me so it's about like you know how you are designed to spend more. It's a very famous document it came like couple of months back right. Please watch it. It's excellent. I am forgetting the name it's like I am not getting it's a story like I know every note I am not able to speak out the name. But anyways as it's a very nice documentary I'll send it on like WhatsApp group okay. So buy out no not buy out something like that totally right. Buy now yes buy now yes that was the documentary it's a very good documentary please watch it. It's about how brands make you buy more how we are programmed to buy buy more and one of the things that caught my attention on that documentary was that there are many brands for example Chanel for example Louis Vuitton they they discard a lot of their inventory and at the time of discarding their inventory they literally cut it. Okay why because if for example you give this inventory to some homeless people okay and homeless people are walking around with Chanel bags okay. What do you think like customers will think okay. So they would rather discard that stock cut it bring it to zero rather than donate it okay. So that's the idea okay. So this is like fairly common practice with luxury brands everyone does it right. Because they don't want to associate a classic case study is that if you prove to the world that you are the poorest person in your society what should you do. You should buy a Tata what's the name that's small car nanow. Okay. Tata nanow you buy okay and roam around in it and that's an indication to the world that you are the poorest person you have worse off than not having a car at all. Okay so that's the reason why Tata nanofield because it was a it was a stamp on your head that you know you can't afford something nice okay. So which is bad right that's the brand image and therefore brands signaling effect is very powerful okay. Whether we like it or not right. So that's the concept of value chain and now I'll not bore you more right. So there was 17 18 points that we studied right please revise the class from the morning. Total addressable market. We spoke about profit margins should be high capital intensive businesses we should generally avoid. We should invest in business where ROIC or return on invested capital slash ROC is higher than weighted average cost of capital. It should be able to do vertical horizontal integration. It should be in in elastic product not elastic products right. The firm should have a brand firm should have a strategy it should have survivability it should be able to survive for the next five years now what is the what is the. What you got winning advantage of something like Amazon. In the brand is very solid right. So Amazon if they decide to do something next it's so wide that that it's amazing okay. Now why you should not bet against companies like Google okay. Meta Apple Amazon because people the way they will think is that for example Google stock right has fallen by like 20 to 23% from its peak people are saying that Google is done why because 60% of its business depends on ad words so sorry advertising revenue. And because publics it is taking away and these LLMs are taking away this Google search advertising revenue right. People are thinking that Google is gone. But the point is that the brand value of Google is massive okay that itself is more valuable than public city okay it's not just about the utility of a thing it's also about the brand value of a thing okay. So brand value is crazy okay so these companies have survived in the social media world where people do not have five minute attention span. And if you associate with a brand right that's all it right so even if tomorrow for example Google decides to buy a sports league and do something with it they have the money they have the cash if they decide to do something else run experiments right for example in US right it's a very clear like they have something called as acquisition okay. All these companies Google meta Apple Amazon they work on a range of experimental products okay. Which we are doing right which we don't even know of right for example like you know how to like send people on like Saturn or something okay so they might be thinking something on those lines all right and they might be running some experiments on that okay. Now employees at Google Amazon Apple they are well paid and they have a very clear road map that our company Google is going to spend money on this what they do is that they leave the company okay build this particular startup come back sell it to Google and join this team okay which was building this okay. So they get rich in the process they get to an equity and they have a very clear understanding and it's completely legal it's not as if that this is illegal if you have friends like Google Amazon meta these companies have acquisition budget so expecting me that I as a stock investor would know that everything that Google is doing is nonsense I would not know okay. So these are like their internal dynamics we don't know how they are going to deal with this 60% like whatever their revenue is where will they pivot to we do know right. The smartest people are working on it let them handle it they will figure it out how to do it okay. Our job is to buy uncertainty okay. So I hope that this point is clear to everyone right. The moat or winning advantage that these companies have is very simple number one they have billions of dollars of cash okay in their repository number two if they want to raise more funds they can easily do it number three they're a brand value is excellent number four they are in tech they specialize in tech they can attract some of the world's best tech talent even now for example if you get a chance to work with publicity versus Google where would you work most likely Google I don't know like some in at least the decision will be split okay that's the power right and because tech is what tech is made on people right so if you have smart developers smart engineers with people who are thinking long term building things and if you have luck going away then you will be able to extend so discounting these companies is a big mistake right now right that's what I would say I'm not saying that go and over invest in this but having like maybe 5% of exposure to Google 5% of exposure to Amazon 5% of exposure to Microsoft makes sense in a diversified format. If you throw the question at me that tell me whether Google will win this particular race or Microsoft I don't know okay but one of the following companies only will win okay that's like pretty given these companies are not going anywhere in the next 3 to 5 years okay so I hope that this point is clear to everyone okay all right okay so this was quantitative sorry this was business analysis now let me talk about like portfolio building on this class right and sentiment analysis this is something that I wanted to quickly touch up on okay now sentiment analysis is something that chat GPT or LLMs cannot do because this has to do with human sentiments okay simplest things in the world generate the most powerful results not now but from time in memorial okay for example what is the simplest thing in the world in let's say if you're building a career in 1990s what should you have done well learn coding learn IT okay that was great why because this trend was starting okay in 2025 what is it the simplest thing that you can do to win in the world yeah right so I mean if you learn AI ML all that stuff if you are 17 18 20 year old right focusing here makes a lot more sense if you are in early like 2000s right what should you have done right MBA was a great kind of an option but if you zoom out and step back and see what what is happening like you know from a structure point of view well the point is that doing these things early kind of made sense okay now what does that means that if everyone is going this way you go this way okay what is the worst thing that you can do like I mean or what I see like a lot of people in their late 20s early 30s what's the number one career mistake that you made I don't even need to take up all doing engineering comes feature at the top of your list is it all is it not okay so why because out of so there was like Zachary Khan's stand-up comedy up is up so I'm borrowing this line from there that out of four people or four meals in India five are engineers okay so which is actually true okay so that is actually true right why because if so many engineers are there what's the value of engineering nothing right so that's the bottom line right so you have to do something unique so sentiment is what like you have to be an intelligent contrarian then only well this built okay either you build build well by you doing arbitrage now what is arbitrage the seno okay casinos from time in immemorial have been minting money why because the house always wins this or whatever like this jume last started like long time ago and it still kind of works go to last Vegas casino capital go to Macau casino capital Chinese people love to gamble mainland China I don't think gambling is allowed right so they go to Macau they burn money you wait right strike like gambling is strictly prohibited by religion so what is the workaround that Dubai slash away yes figure it out and main cardinilla land we are doing it on sea bottom right so that's the thing okay so we are doing like building like Russell came a casino on see okay so that is win casino which is there like let go okay so no goa there is a casino online it's called Zwarri White Sands right so it's in warka right I have a bottom of first property there so it's like walkable took from there okay I have never been to like you know Zwarri White Sands but I'm just telling you okay so Zuri White Sands something like this right so that's that okay so so the bottom line being that you either make money through arbitrage which is casino gambling dream 11 astrology and the book the right and all that stuff right so I mean these are like religion right so this is like arbitrage okay or you do by being contraivian these are your two options okay so there is no third option third is consistent compounding for example if you do everything as a system right then you make money right because other people are finding it difficult to invest in a system so on that note how do we relate this knowledge to the stock market so for this you need to study phases in the stock market stock market goes through the following phase okay so number one phase is there is some kind of crash okay number two and whenever there is crash there is panic associated with it okay number two there is built up okay built up everything is demolished now people start building up okay then there is euphoria okay greed right we greed moves into euphoria within a few moments okay okay in fact there is greed third stage four stages euphoria okay and this is crash now can we study this yes pick or decade yes let's pick 2020 right the easiest one 2020 over it crash what happened massive panic almost 35% drop on FT after that 2021 2022 built up right everyone what excited about stock markets there was greed in 2022 one could say euphoria and after that there was another mini crash okay that happened by 2022 okay so this was the cycle now this cycle goes went faster okay now if I show this to you on a chart just a minute show this to you on a chart okay so if we go right and let's study like S&P 500 so Indian stocks can we you can do it you can do it you can do it not at all okay anything that you like so let's go to 2008 right so this was 2008 now this was like this was a crash right built up by this time there was euphoria 2004 selected 2009 seven years of great return everyone is into the stock market right then there was a crash now again euphoria right went up went up went up and then there is a crash okay so the point is that there is always like these phases when there is a crash followed by built up followed by euphoria followed by a crash okay so if you have to just simply plot it okay and this is what your sentiment chart means okay now this happens on short term basis this happens on long term basis and if you purely time your investment decisions based on that you will be fine okay this is probably the most powerful thing right and which has got nothing to do with finance but still everything to do with finance okay now what type of phase are we in right now is this euphoria is this greed no like I would say built up okay so so yeah so basically now what happens is that people think that this always like the first thing needs to leads to second thing leads to third thing no basically it can fluctuate also right so for example there is crash right crash is clear okay then the market dipped okay second is built up okay third is greed okay fourth is euphoria okay and then there is crash okay now what happens is that what is happening now is that see there was a very clear crash in 2020 then market started to getting rebuilt right then 20 then greed euphoria happened right and then there was a mini crash okay mini crash okay then we went to build up right immediately right then built up there was a greed right then there was a little bit of crash minus 10 percent then again we went into build up okay so it works like this okay so for example if right now we try to see that is this like um people are like you know increasing their SIPs decreasing their SIP what is happening etc etc then then we can get an estimate now how to calculate all this okay so that's an interesting question so let me try to do this and the easiest way is to figure out your time horizon of investing because greed euphoria etc only works when your time horizon is clear and for this you need to know the type of an investor you are for example I am a 3 to 5 air investor okay now what do I mean by 3 to 5 air it means that's it today if I'm putting like one lakh rupees in the market I am okay holding it till 2028 okay does this mean that I will definitely hold it till 2028 no right I'm gonna go a pathraba liqueh dodiya right I mean it's not like that right so if I get an opportunity to book profit I'll do it but at least till 2028 I don't need this money okay so I'll put it in the stock market and see what happens okay whatever decisions I'm taking I'm taking it on a three-year basis okay now for this you need to study number one the asset that you are analyzing so here what asset are we analyzing here we are analyzing S&P 500 which is the broad market index now if you are analyzing Nasdaq that is a tech index both of them work differently okay similarly if you are analyzing small cap index it will work differently then nifty 50 so on and so forth everyone with me okay all right now what I would say is that if you have to do sentiment analysis right on a 3 to 5 air basis the longer your horizon the easier it gets okay so for example a 3 to 5 air investor will think like this that hey see right now this is if I look at technicals so I'll analyze like weekly candle first weekly and monthly candles I'll do this analysis weekly candle what can I see that hey this is a channel that was being formed and I had sent this homework so I hope that you guys did it how could draw trend lines so I'm not speaking about that this is resistance this is support what is likely to happen is that this will touch this this will fall and this channel is likely to be respected okay so here should I add anything maybe if I'm undervalued S&P 500 depending on my portfolio for example let's say my portfolio is once he are it relax in India 20 lacks in the US okay I want to transfer this portfolio into the US so that could be one of my goals okay so what I might want a picture of my portfolio is 60% to you India and 40 like US okay so this is what I want to do now here is the S&P 500 somewhat sensible for me yes okay so yes I know because I want to anyways put more money okay but what should I definitely not do I should not go all in okay at least on a short term basis everyone understand why not go all in what is an all-in point all-in point is this okay maybe okay even here you should not go all-in but if you want to do all-in respecting this channel then this is fine somewhat okay this is a short term trend this is called as uptrend okay so I I'll just quickly talk about this in a minute so three types of trends that we have studied right so this is an uptrend right this is an uptrending market okay still ideally we should invest majority of our money in a downtrending market okay right now this is an uptrend everyone understands why this is an uptrend okay what is a downtrend this is a downtrend everyone can see why is this a downtrend okay what is a sideways trend this is a sideways trend okay it goes like this and from 15 to almost 17 18 this is a sideways trend okay this is an uptrend okay this is a side trend okay this is an uptrend okay so you'll have uptrends downtrend okay this is an uptrend right and similarly this might or might not be a downtrend a downtrend would be when it looks something like this yeah from here on a weekly calendar okay so it falls like this there is a channel breakdown right and it goes something like this okay so something like this could happen okay everyone understands I'll just draw this like a little bit more carefully right this important point to notice that's this is an uptrend everyone understand why this is an uptrend okay what will be a downtrend here that it goes something like this so this is a downtrend okay downtrend typically means that you will have higher lows okay so for example this low is this high is lower than the previous high okay this high is lower than the previous high this high is lower than the previous high everyone got it what is the meaning of downtrend for example here this is a high this is a high this is a high and this is a trend reversal in the middle but these three things are downtrend everyone with me okay now if you study this right from a sentiment so we are trying to do a sentiment analysis okay when do you think so our goal is to buy bearish sentiment okay three types of sentiments are there bearish bullish neutral okay we can add more stuff in bearish we can add more stuff in neutral we don't buy much in bullish okay it will look counter intuitive then okay why you not buying in bullish you sell in bullish okay you don't buy in bullish okay three types of trends bearish bullish and neutral now what type of trend is this this is a bullish trend okay why because this is an uptrend okay now is there panic right now no when will there be a panic okay when this corrects a lot okay when that trend reverses that is when panic is when we go in a down trend that's when panic will happen especially if the market corrects a lot from its top okay from here to here market is corrected by minus 10 percent okay but the trend is still bullish this might get a little bit complicated so please listen carefully okay the trend is bullish okay but what might happen is that it will touch like this it will go up okay it will touch like this it will go up okay and as long as this channel is this being respected this is still an uptrend you're getting it okay and this is where people get confused right that okay you're saying uptrend and you're saying down trend also then you know so we're not getting it what I'm trying simply trying to say is that if you study this channel okay this is an uptrending channel okay now it can go in two ways from here where we currently are we are here okay one has that it might it might behave like this this is still an uptrend okay or it goes like this right it falls and it goes into a down trend okay if we get to buy this and this is where panic will be and if this happens was then a Mandir Chattayana mid-hybridized right so whenever you see this because that is when you can go and buy another house okay so like I feel very happy when the session comes okay so like I'm jubiliant okay in your youtube you recently mentioned if Tlb sideways next couple of years how do you say that what do I know yes I'll speak about that also but I hope everyone understands what is the meaning of uptrend and down trend as long as we are in an uptrend there is no panic let people make noise okay people will truly panic when the market corrects by 20% from the top of 15% from the top and we are in a down trend okay that is when you should have money to invest in the stock markets if you don't have money to invest in the stock market you will not make much money okay and even if at that point in time you are just simply buying indexes it's fine not a big deal okay now this situation can happen at an individual stock level also or index also so let me explain it by using Google example okay so for example I'll for bet okay okay okay now what type of now this is panic okay what do you see this was an uptrend you can see okay and if this was respected this would have been in an uptrend okay but it broke okay and it has corrected by how much 25% from its top okay and maybe it's in a down trend now right that only time will tell us okay okay now what is happening here okay so what is happening here is that see this will become might it might become like this right then it might go sideways okay it might fall again I don't know but the point is that this is a great time to buy this stock okay why because you are buying a down trend when the stock has corrected by more than 20% a good company okay now therefore like learning individual stock investing is critical because many a times you don't get an opportunity to buy S&P 500 on as time but you get an opportunity to buy an excellent stock at very good valuations yes I'm buying Google yes okay so yeah okay now this is called as position building right this comes with experience and you'll say yeah it's not so much as I'm just there's a poor lane nothing can be done like it's like everyone can do do gardening no it's a very time consuming patient process it's like raising a child right so it requires massive patients okay so you're still in the arms you're going to be in the next six years right so I mean it's not so much patients it's right so it doesn't make sense okay then you'll wait for another fall after like two three years and all that whenever you are getting an opportunity buy it okay now you'll say that okay what's the guarantee that Google will come up therefore we have a rule of diversification that we will not invest more than five percent of our capital on any single stock now you'll say that that doesn't make us very comfortable you are a research analyst right you should you should learn like about every stock how would I know okay you're not sure which I does not know what he's going to do next okay so even he does not know how AI will evolve it's useless nonsense for me to go and analyze like their companies every move it doesn't add up okay broad broad it should add up okay so for example it's like this your mom and dad video career decision okay like all boys here Karadina engineering right so it's not as if key but a good decision we have to start right so then they knew you from Buchpan right so your parents have done like PhD on you and still they suggested you like engineering career path or whatever right so bottom line being that over analyzing it also does not really help okay you have to do like broad analysis only okay so broad analysis here tells us they're right now you're getting to buy Google at good sentiments okay why because they are in a bearish sentiment okay number two the trend has changed the trend has become a downtrend okay should you over invest in snp 500 no because we have to wait for a trend reversal on that okay now comes if we add both of these things okay for example this is Google right it has fallen by 25 percent I'd shown you snp 500 that snp 500 was going something like this it was somewhere here okay now imagine this that if snp 500 also breaks this line and falls below this trend and the trend reversal happens trend the reversal happens here also here trend reversal has already happened yeah on Google what do you think is going to happen on Google it will fall more why because if the entire index is falling Google will also fall Google is not like you know made up like something okay what now this is this is like see if you get to buy an individual asset on a downtrend it's great okay if the market is also on a downtrend and panic if the individual stock is also on a downtrend and panic and then you get to buy that is when real wealth is made okay so that's the idea okay that if that happens that's a situation to be really happy about okay because you will genuinely only make money when you are investing at decent prices if you are buying at crazy premiums for example many of you have the habit can't go to buy the Loda you will be building you will be going by like we will buy from Iran money only you will not make any money okay so and I'm going to buy you will only buy E-MAR or whatever right so you might never make money E-MAR see very good example is that if you buy Bursh Khalifa facing apartments you have to pay Bursh Khalifa facing prices okay you will not get Bursh Khalifa facing apartments facing like noida getter prices okay so that's like noida has like lot of getters price I mean that prices you'll not get okay so that's how it goes okay it's like common sense it's not as if that E-MAR if they are building something in front of Bursh Khalifa fully would Bursh Khalifa apartment you'll get it at cheap no you are paying commiserate prices if there is a price mismatch due to sentiments then only you will get something at decent price where you will be able to make money okay this is complicated point I don't know you whether you guys got it or not it was difficult to teach also but these are insightful points that will actually help you make money okay now what happens in like Google's case okay so what are you exactly buying here you are buying something called as uncertainty you don't know what is going to happen to Google's business therefore there it has gone into a downtrend and therefore you are buying it whenever Google decides after six eight months 12 months that hey here is our revival plan what do you think is going to happen to Google stock people will become certain the sentiments will become Bursh and you are going to immediately make money on your investment okay so what are you betting on on Google not uptrend right you're betting on Google's ability to build a revival plan and communicate it in media okay you don't give a shative Google survive after five years if you invest today and if it goes up by 50% sell it make your money or whatever right and go out okay so why are you like mad at Google okay so the bottom line is that you bought a panic you waited for a turn around and you stole it okay everyone with me okay so this is the meaning of uptrend downtrend buying it on sentiments okay now let me tell you like opposite case right so far example if you look at small cap 250 yeah now this is yeah I have to use my cap okay now this is now many people are saying that you know what was small cap now here you need to know basic math okay so basic math and ability in fact mid cap because small cap index is not that old and mid cap and small cap indices work similarly okay mid cap 150 okay now for example from here from here like forget about like covid crash okay so we look at it from pre-COVID okay now pre-COVID in five years small cap 150 gave 250% run up okay on a five-year basis this is almost 40% CAs year everyone gets it okay now what is the average CAs year of mid cap companies it is roughly 20% 20 21% so this was almost 2x run up that had happened on it everyone gets how right how did I reach this conclusion because the average CAs year of mid cap companies is 21% or 22% but in the last five years right including covid this was 40% so here can you say that it is definitely euphoric right back in whatever this date is so this is complete euphoria okay you will see mutual funds coming out and saying that you know boss we just cannot take any more money from you okay we are making you know a lot of commissions from you but we cannot take that money okay and you are almost like you know doubling like and they stopped taking money also many mutual funds they stopped their inflows in the scheme and that point in time this is this rarely happens okay now what should you do you should at least book some profits how much I don't know okay but at least some profits should be booked luckily I and I exited all my small mid cap indexes and this is the reason why I love index investing in mid caps and small caps because they are very easy to exit okay otherwise if you buy like Phalanad Incac want active mutual funds small cap or something problem is that how would you exit okay so you don't know like what the underlying assets are okay so here this is definitely euphoric and if you go and have conversations with people in like 23 and everyone was excited about your mid cap right small cap right so I will also go and buy more and more okay problem is that do you do not you should not be buying too much on an uptrend okay when should you buy much of the stuff right for example please check my videos right and there was a time approximately like one minute half year when I barely invested any money in the markets okay therefore I'm flushed with liquidity I have like 70 80 percent of my entire capital of a million dollars which I could potentially in fact two million dollars I can invest so everything I'm aware right in like UA right so like I I'm just waiting the eye to recession right now I'm going to right so another recession right so what would you right so so so that's the bottom line right that you have to like for example this is and clear uptrend right you can see this is uptrend this was one uptrend this was consolidation then there was second uptrend so there are two uptrends that have happened right massive right you are setting at 2x the average return what there should be now what is likely to happen from this point so below the edge are you are doing post-martama analysis what is the future tell me this okay future is very simple that it is likely going to be sideways okay so this is going to be a consolidation or a sideways market for midcaps okay this is not going to give you any crazy returns right unless the returns normalize now what is the meaning of returns normalizing it means that for example right many people are saying that hey you know what liquidity let's say it was 100 units they brought it up to 150 units yes therefore two uptrends have happened right uptrend one uptrend two okay now what will happen to the liquidity the liquidity increase will be slowed down I'm not saying that it will not grow but what is the moral responsibility of large caps fund managers small and midcaps fund managers what is a moral responsibility here they have to give you 12% toughly here they are very happy 20% this is the more that they give right it's like the conversation between kids and parents okay so parents are not going to be anything for example if you take get like 90% marks in 10th okay then if you get 89% marks in 12th they will say you number them guess over them are you know you are you are a party get there they say but if you are a smart kid you will get 60% to begin with in 10th right and when you score like 80% in 12 your parents same parents will give you like metay and you know all the money they will give you so it's like that okay so for example now if you're mutual fund manager right your expectation is that I have 20 20 I have one message I have 20 40% years you are I was saying can realistically like a mutual fund manager keep on generating that return for you on a four five year basis thing from their perspective right because who moves the market mutual fund managers okay you are doing your SIP and it's their job to move the market now let's say that for the next two years now returns go sideways okay now if someone was started there investing in 2020 on small caps or midgaps okay midgaps and small caps give similar returns so let's say let's extend this right that we reach here and till 2018 okay so how many years eight years we make 218% returns so how much is the CAs here almost like 20% okay what do you think mutual fund managers will say mutual fund managers will say that see look at our funds return if you would have invested money in 2020 with us just before covid and if you would have stayed invested in the market with us till 20 28 you would have been making 20% returns now you say that I was a great idiot that I cut my mutual fund does that so I'm going to go like I'm going to go to the right so everyone got this point small cap 250 I can't show because the index started like 2019 or something 2020 or something okay so it's exactly the same you can do it at your own convenience okay and this is how mutual fund so you have to think from their perspective that's he was like right now there is no incentive for them to give you any returns okay even now the returns are over bloated okay so now you're at like 30% CAs or whatever okay now they will take it sideways and that's how they are going to do it on a five year basis now what other measure do mutual fund guys take they look at 10 year okay so look at our 10 year rolling return whatever okay so we'll be there let's go 2015 okay so this is 2015 okay so from here to here it's almost 400% right now it's almost 330 right in 10 years so this is again like more than 25 26% CAs here I'm talking about now almost 26% so still it's like 6% CAs here more on early basis so another avenue for another like you know 15 20% correction okay now two things can happen either there will be a price correction or there will be a time correction other if price correction then we need another 15% price correction fast then it becomes viable or it goes sideways in this market right for another maybe like two years for this return to normalize on a 10 year basis on a five year basis on a three year basis because this is the report card that your mutual fund managers are going to show you okay and this is the only thing that you need to worry about every on with me okay okay now comes Nazdaq okay so Nazdaq is an interesting animal right and it's a very difficult animal because I'm like okay so QQQ okay so here we are okay so let's do the same analysis on Nazdaq now Nazdaq is a tech index now the growth of a tech index in the US in US dollar terms roughly around 12 13% right because this is the rate at which these companies typically grow okay so now if you do like 10 year analysis okay on Nazdaq this is 20 20 okay so on a 10 year basis 10 12% it looks fairly valued okay now okay after this correction so this is five year basis so this is overvalued okay this is like well it means just going with the law or even if I look at the overvalued okay so this is roughly like what 17 18% C.H. here yeah last five years okay is this overvalued yes on a five year basis okay what about 10 year basis okay so let's do that okay at least these two numbers are very important so 2015 we go we plot this this is almost 360 360 if there are 10 year basis case of say Karoge so this was we like again like what more than like 20% okay so this is very bloated okay still okay so the point being that this is not a great time to over invest in the US market okay why because both five year candles and 10 year candles tell us realistically that the market is overvalued and when I say such statements we forget very disappointed here I'm doing yeah gambling earn you really I'm sure right so that is something that I can't do right I'm not teaching investing for entertainment purpose okay if it is overvalued it is overvalued I can't do anything okay go planetary like see them a mango tree grow okay so if you want to time pass okay so now that's better use of your time okay every girl around the boomo dunia or any other chemen you are not like then we will analyze like Nile's attack again okay which is kind of sensible okay nifty 50 again you do the same right nifty 50 okay nifty 50 index so okay so for example I'm already going to do right so this is 80% now 80% on a five year basis is how much 14 14% see here this is not over bloated this is somewhat reasonable okay if we go like 10 year basis right so this is 2014 this 15 wrap right so 164 on a 10 year basis again this is 1314% so this is not over bloated this looks fairly ugly everyone with me okay but now you say where I get to fit they are in the market well that's right but see now you have to start thinking on a on a Britannia zomato basis okay now where do you think investors will gravitate Britannia or zomato this is not where I think they will gravity they are already are okay why because zomato is a growth stock similarly at an economy level also there are growth economies and then there are de-growth economies what are growth economies in 2025 China very bullish US tech very bullish they are bringing jobs to the US structurally they are still number one consumers in the world right they have massive money printing power safety heaven in the world right etc etc similarly same applies to China India used to be an emerging market play everyone was betting on the fact that you know what India's demographic dividend will be there our middle class will rise our GDP per capita will grow really fast right 2014 when Modi ji came right and there was a lot of you know positive sentiments okay now what the sentiments are like on India right right now from an international investing community it's neutral to bearish right that's what we'll put okay so it's not like as bullish as it used to be right so there is no sentiment right so it's like so Moinesh Vavarai says that buy something which is ignored and unloved okay so is India ignored or unloved right now no okay so it's not because Moinesh Vavarai is a value investor we are mix of value and growth okay so we still have to invest our money in growth markets okay so we cannot like not monitor our Indian investments but it's not as if that you are buying like really expensive on a 10 year basis if you put your money in nifty 50 right now it's okay it's not as if that it will go to dust or something okay you will still be able to exit it at a healthy rate not an issue okay with the US markets you have to be strategic okay now you will say that you're going to want to accept like I want to invest in like Nasdaq okay so let's pull up Nasdaq okay so this is Nasdaq right and let me just erase all this okay okay now you'll say that okay I want to invest in Nasdaq uh but it looks overvalued what should I do should I like just not invest ever right how should I build positions slowly uh what what precisely is it that I should be doing well you should buy as per a technicals okay so you should buy on short term technicals you should buy on long term technicals and for example if you consider this this is like somewhat of a buying opportunity you can buy like one big bulk here stay put this is second support level this is third support level so you only buy on technicals that's point one okay that you buy only on technicals number two point is that you have something called as cash hedge okay am I saying that you need to have cash hedge in India probably no you can probably be like 95% invested in Indian markets when it comes to the US market you should at least have 20 to 30% cash hedge right now what does this mean that if your total portfolio size in the US is one growth okay maximum you can invest a 70 lakhs keep 30 lakhs 20 to 30 lakhs has liquid cash in your FD's or whatever which you can deploy whenever these points start to hit okay natural question will come that okay you know why like do all this right I mean I would rather wait for a recession to come okay I will wait like you know till that time I get like good value okay on this market because you are saying that you know NASDAQ should give like 12 to 13% CGR maybe like 15% malo if it takes a lot of days okay but right now it is giving like 20% CGR okay so why can't I wait till that time the valuations normalize right that's a very legitimate question right see the problem is that again like the entire mid gap 250 story okay okay now mid gap had given an uptrend year also okay so for example if you study like this entire space on a five-year basis right sorry 10 8 year basis this this chart right this block here mid gaps was overvalued okay you would not have entered mid gaps till here right or you would have sold to early okay what I'm trying to tell you is that something which is overvalued can become hyper overvalued before it corrects okay and in this entire phase how much potential gains did you miss you missed almost like 40 50% run up okay 56% run up okay and again please this might again look very contrairian but you will you make losses in the market because you keep on waiting okay so that is like a bad aspect no so you would not know that right I mean how much something can get overvalued okay for example NASDAQ might very well go to x from this point okay but what you can use is that you can use little bit of technical knowledge okay so for example NASDAQ yeah okay so for example here let's assume that it moves in an uptrend okay so let's build that okay let's say that this entire channel gets followed okay something like this right okay so let's say that NASDAQ now I don't know which of the following things will play out one option is that one option is okay yeah one option is that it will go like this right and it stayed stays overvalued because if the uptrend continues NASDAQ will remain overvalued for how many years I don't know it can happen it can remain overvalued for five years it can remain overvalued for another 10 years I don't know okay this is this no one can say but what can I definitely do I can rotate capital right I buy it here and if for example I am investing let's say 10 lakh on this trade or 15% of my US capital here then I sell some of this capital like so let's say this is like 15 thousand dollars okay 15 thousand dollars if I'm getting here then what I will do on this 15 this will go by how much so this will go up by roughly 20% okay now 15 becomes like 18 now how much do I take out so I take out like six seven thousand dollars then I play around or like I take out half of it okay then I let it fall not a problem maybe there will be a breakout also who knows okay and then I play that okay so this is called as position sizing this is something that you will learn only with experience once you start doing it you yourself will understand what strategy is making more sense there is no mathematics okay here that okay I don't know you block or know all that stuff the idea is to have some real profits along this trend line you keep on you do not invest more in a trend okay bossaalani a profit big he loves okay not a problem okay so this will give you confidence also so this is one okay this is very important and you maintain that 25 30% cash hedge till that time this is going up okay now if there is a correction that comes here okay so you go something like this and then there is another breakdown and we are seeing something like this okay and this happens after four years okay so this happens in 2020 okay for example this is the 2030 line now in by 2030 right this entire trend over the last 15 years the market have now become more rationalized from an overall valuation perspective everyone understanding what I'm trying to say okay the point I'm trying to tell you is that see there is enough room for people to play around with this and make a lot of money along the way okay if you get to buy like for example now what can happen max right what can happen max is that see this continues you keep on rotating your capital you keep on making your 5% 5% you know profit and you keep on adding more capital here till that I am this trend is followed and when there is a breakdown okay and if the valuations look reasonable then you invest big okay with your cash capital that is that you're having that 20 30% cash positions everyone is understanding or is this getting like little bit more complicated no it will be complicated right I mean this like we have in the last few sessions okay so anyways I hope that this is clear right and this was important right that you trend to follow it okay don't bet on the fact that the market will fall in the next 3 months 6 months we don't know okay therefore like the key takeaway is that you don't you at least keep 50% or close to 50% of your capital in the markets all the time unless there is a very clear euphoria okay this is very very difficult to time okay 50% of your capital should always be in the market why because it allows you to capital rotate some of it okay so for example if I have 1 million dollar as my budget I will definitely invest 500 thousand US dollars this year and I've already invested like 260 270 okay right and rest also I will be investing right this year now point is how do we build like all that I'll explain it in a minute right but important point is that we are always invested 50 percent all that time number two this is one golden rule right number two golden rule is that if the market looks from a long term perspective five year ten year perspective overvalued we at least have 20 percent cash positions okay this is golden rule number three number three we invest this 20 percent cash positions when there is a break down and the valuations look somewhat fair at fair valuation we invest for example nifty 50 right now seems at a reasonable valuation so we are fully invested in the Indian market okay US stocks are not at fair valuation according to my analysis or sorry US index is not at a fair valuation as per my analysis therefore maintaining this 20 percent is critical when should I invest it whenever this 20 percent 25 percent correction happens okay and final golden nugget that I will give you is that see anytime like literally anytime when the market has corrected by more than 20 percent right any pick any okay in the US you will always make returns for example this was a 20 percent fall this was a 20 percent fall right if you go back study any history this was a 20 percent fall if you invest at any 20 percent fall you will 100 percent make returns okay that's that's going to happen so the only reason why you would not be able to make 20 percent sorry you would not be able to make returns when the market falls by 20 percent as you run out of money okay and you will never run out of money if you are not investing from a long term if you are not checking the over valuation zone okay a little bit complicated stuff so I'll take like one two questions okay and then we will break out for a break okay okay on this mid gap can you help understand the short term play considering see short term is very difficult to do right and mid gap I'm not doing I'm a long term sensible investor for example if the index looks 2x bloated will I go and will I go and invest more on small cap mid caps now no I would rather by like time correction what I will what is my strategy on mid caps now okay so I'll just weekly tell you so for example mid cap is going to go mid cap 150 this is mid cap 150 now what what is it what is my expectations the number one is that see this is likely to go sideways this is what I'm anticipating this is definitely overvalued right now right now is this the bottom I don't know but we can consider this to be the temporary bottom now it might go up like this now it might go like like this because I'm anticipating a sideways consolidation so buying zone for me will be this okay the next time it hits there you will say that a chasagani then maybe this channel will get formed I don't know right so it will go something like this okay then I will buy this right or whatever it is right so we have to wait here right I mean there because there is no clear picture that is emerging here right and it is very much overvalued so there is no point and also there are no long term growth prospects that that are bullish right because majority of the mid cap and small cap companies are manufacturing manufacturing sucks and India right now okay so there is no long term play for example if I have to speculate on valuations I would rather go and invest in Chinese market I would rather go and invest in Nazdaq because long term growth growth people are going to chase but in small mid caps in India the manufacturing sucks and it and if the manufacturing growth rate in India is 2.5% right now right so and it goes to like 3 it's hoarded okay so it's like worse than the US economies growth rate so why would it keep on growing at 20% CSER right so it doesn't make much sense okay so therefore I don't see any point in speculating I'm adding I'm using like macro knowledge business analysis technicals and then I'm making like my buy cell calls everyone is getting us okay so I'm trying to give you a flip okay okay paratha yeah recently I saw an interview where some of the one of the new news channels was a person from some foreign investment firm very called Zomato as a one dollar business and to be honest somewhere I feel Zomato doesn't have a basic or a business at what you say at the core core of the businesses just delivering food food is one started with that okay now it's been expanding its wins so I just want to know on what what basis was that comment given by your Paris but if I'm not wrong it's it was a Paris fund investment guy who who gave that who said that it is a one dollar business and it has no growth as far as I see I mean honestly like people say 100 different things I'm not here to like you know criticize or defend anyone's comments right up you just and honestly like bottom line is very simple right that if you are betting on India's consumption then which businesses are you going to pick every business will be like this only right so if you like this is at least a segment and which jobs are getting created this is at least a segment in which the overall revenues are growing at a crazy pace it's not my opinion versus his opinions just open up the recent results if the revenue growth is growing at like you know 100% a year close to right I don't have to defend that business right I mean that's that's that right I mean it's not about defending it but what if it is at one point what if big players enter into this business for example Zomato has started with Zepto and similarly now there is big basket from Tata and now what if Amazon also enters into this 10 minute delivery thing and the small time it lets Zomato can definitely give up some market to them not really man I mean see even like they are a category leader at something so till that I mean they are there uses by good valuation I'm not saying that go in my Zomato or never sell it I myself sold Zomato that's not the point I made like 100% returns on it when that time comes I'll add more of it right I have little bit of positions on Zomato I have positions on Spighi we'll see how the market evolves why speculative right for example by that logic because Amazon is there like then you know no one should not exist in UA right or like nothing should exist then only Zomato should I mean Amazon should do business every right so that doesn't it wasn't worth that very right okay thank you sir I'll take like couple of two quick questions and then we'll take a short hiya Gideeshha hi Akshad very quickly so in this so let's say today with my small and mid gap portfolio I am at no profit no loss right so considering that we just went through how the small mid gap both are over valued and might be like a two three or consolidation pace or a time correction pace would you suggest that I get out of the entire investment very hard to because a very hard hard to do because you know it was at a 20 25% positive and then look at fresh ways of you know deploying that capital the woodback makes sense I don't like I mean see because you are you have to play with it's a probabilistic analysis okay it's not stock market is not short short thing okay you just have to play with the probabilities right for example if I give you an advice that okay ZDS it looks overvalued then you might get out of it tomorrow right and suddenly there is a 5% run up for whatever reasons and say yeah it's like mad right I mean he gave me a strong advice I cannot say anything on that right but I can simply say is that see this is what data tells us that he on a ten year basis is it overvalued yes on a short term basis it overvalued yes on a three year basis is it overvalued yes okay let's look at things from our fund managers point of view if someone is running a mid gap small cap fund they are CGR because they are not withdrawing money from the market right like technically speaking their fund is still giving like 30 35% CGR because they are they will show you return on pre-COVID basis so for them they are showing that 40% 30 whatever like you know 30 35% CGR so their returns make sense so they are no incentive to pump the market mid gap small cap so chances to me on capital correction or sorry consolidation is very high and the chances for like sideways slash downward might happen because price correction or time correction should happen that's what I think should you exit it completely I don't know right I mean that really depends on where you will reinvest this capital etc etc right if you buy wrong I can't help you out right I mean if you don't book profits at the right time I can't help you out right I mean then it becomes a difficult conversation right with with lines understood understood so not looking at like like a recommendation from your end but let's say if you were in this situation how would you even look at it like how how do I look at it to let's say at least protect my capital where it is like how how would you sort of begin to analyze it you know like see I'll put in you where it has the highest so I'll probably like start the class there the next class there right so allowing some time if it doesn't get answered I'll answer it in the end okay sure one quick question I'll take so one and then I'll yeah actually our last week classes I got know what capital rotation is I did some bit of capital rotation last one week but one my question was there are the strategies called coffee can investing and things like that so are there signs which I need to look forward to say that hey this talk is a blind long term investment like 10 years so do one thing read coffee can investing number two then Google like who wrote coffee can investing the number three search performance of this fund manager in the last five years then you'll say that okay the market gave like 23% C.H.R.S fund perform minus nine okay then you should ask that should you be taking advice no okay I'm not trying to be sly or like you know beans in here that's what it is right I mean it's a merit oriented industry if you can't perform then get out right that's the bottom line right so otherwise why are you why are people paying you two percent of the AUM like just to tell stories right so doesn't make sense no I mean see it's very simple right I mean if something has been oversimplified it's not going to give you returns when I say people get mad at me that you're missing on SIPs SIPs are being overdone okay it is not going to give it on so like that's what I feel okay do I have data to prove it now no this books will be written after 15 20 years okay on this right I don't know like so but am I that's like that's true for careers that's true for any comparative good thing that you're doing money making is a competition okay like it or not I'm not trying to like know like so you'll be that idealist again this is what it is okay so if you are not smart if you're not in top 3 4% investors you will not make money from the stock market you should leave stock market that's it because that's what I'll simply say for example gold right now sentiments extremely bullish bullish negative how would you categorize it I would say extremely bullish everyone who can invest in gold is investing in gold will I invest in gold no absolutely not if it is completely bullish it's better to avoid I don't know on what time frame maybe like it will go up in another three months but it's not a buy and hold three to five years also for me okay so max you should look at any investment I want a three to five year basis that's it okay okay guys we'll take like a quick five minute break we'll be back at five fifteen my time okay so
